## Methodology

### Assignment of IDs

#### "r-AuthorInitials-TitleInitials-1" Format

For example, the first note made primarily in reference to John Keynes' _General Theory_ would be r-JK-GT-1, the second would be r-JK-GT-2, etc. See this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Zettelkasten/comments/1f8hap4/how_i_give_ids_to_my_reference_notes/) for more information.

## Selected Notes on Notetaking

_See backlinks for more notes to add to this section_

- [[Note 13#Spatial Repetition and Semantic Association]]
- [[Note 3#Logging Tasks]]
- [[Note 4#Parallel Drafting]]
- [[Note 6#Archiving Unused Notes]]

### Working Process

- As you read
  - record key excerpts to eventually elaborate on, and
  - record any ideas you get, in shorthand.
- After you read,
  - return to key excerpts and elaborate on them, converting the ideas into your language. Format them into notes
  - return to your shorthand ideas and format them as notes.
