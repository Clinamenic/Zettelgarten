### Working Process

- As you read
  - record key excerpts to eventually elaborate on, and
  - record any ideas you get, in shorthand.
- After you read,
  - return to key excerpts and elaborate on them, converting the ideas into your language. Format them into notes
  - return to your shorthand ideas and format them as notes.
