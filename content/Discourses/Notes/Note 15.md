In circumstances where efforts are being made to steer a status quo toward some more ideal state, there may arise a dissonance between the reality of the situation and the representation of the situation, i.e. how the situation is depicted or described. Here, two broad courses of action can be followed, if the dissonance is to be resolved: either conform the reality to the representation, or the representation to the reality. In situations where the representation is closer to the ideal than the reality, the former approach may sometimes serve as a forcing function for the reality to conform to said ideals, rather than capitulating and conforming the representation to the reality, such as it is.
