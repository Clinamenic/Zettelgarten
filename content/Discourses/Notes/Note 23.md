[[Keynes_GeneralTheory#^chapter2section3paragraph2]]

Here Keynes is arguing that a given labor group's negotiations around money wages serves to determine that groups relative real wages, that is, relative to other labor groups. 

#notes/keynes/general-theory/question Is he also saying that a labor group's settlement for lower money wages means that the group also suffers a decrease in real wages, but also that this decrease contributes to a trend of overall increase in real wages across labor groups?
