[[Keynes_GeneralTheory#Chapter 2, Section IV]]

In this section, Keynes defines involuntary unemployment as a phenomenon resulting from circumstances wherein the real wages decrease and both the aggregate supply and aggregate demand for labor at the give money wage exceeds the given capacity for employment. 

#notes/keynes/general-theory/question Does this mean that, so long as the real wage matches or exceeds the the marginal disutility of labor, involuntary labor should not occur and that "full employment" should be attainable?
