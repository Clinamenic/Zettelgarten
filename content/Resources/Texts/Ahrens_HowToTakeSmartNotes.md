## INTRODUCTION

Everybody writes. Especially in academia. Students write and professorswrite. And nonfiction writers, who are the third group of people this book isaiming to help, obviously write as well. And writing doesn’t necessarilymean papers, articles or books, but everyday, basic writing. We write whenwe need to remember something, be it an idea, a quote or the outcome of astudy. We write when we want to organise our thoughts and when we want toexchange ideas with others. Students write when they take an exam, but thefirst thing they do to prepare even for an oral examination is to grab pen andpaper. We write down not only those things we fear we won’t rememberotherwise, but also the very things we try to memorise. Every intellectualendeavour starts with a note.

Writing plays such a central role in learning, studying and research that itis surprising how little we think about it. If writing is discussed, the focus liesalmost always on the few exceptional moments where we write a lengthypiece, a book, an article or, as students, the essays and theses we have to handin. At first glance, that makes sense: these are the tasks that cause the mostanxiety and with which we struggle the longest. Consequently, these “writtenpieces” are also what most self-help books for academics or study guidesfocus on, but very few give guidance for the everyday note-taking that takesup the biggest chunk of our writing.

The available books fall roughly into two categories. The first teaches theformal requirements: style, structure or how to quote correctly. And thenthere are the psychological ones, which teach you how to get it done withoutmental breakdowns and before your supervisor or publisher starts refusing tomove the deadline once more. What they all have in common, though, is that they start with a blank screen or sheet of paper.1 But by doing this, theyignore the main part, namely note-taking, failing to understand thatimproving the organisation of all writing makes a difference. They seem toforget that the process of writing starts much, much earlier than that blankscreen and that the actual writing down of the argument is the smallest part ofits development. This book aims to fill this gap by showing you how to efficiently turn your thoughts and discoveries into convincing written piecesand build up a treasure of smart and interconnected notes along the way. Youcan use this pool of notes not only to make writing easier and more fun foryourself, but also to learn for the long run and generate new ideas. But mostof all, you can write every day in a way that brings your projects forward.Writing is not what follows research, learning or studying, it is the mediumof all this work. And maybe that is the reason why we rarely think about thiswriting, the everyday writing, the note-taking and draft-making. Likebreathing, it is vital to what we do, but because we do it constantly, it escapesour attention. But while even the best breathing technique would probablynot make much of a difference to our writing, any improvement in the waywe organise the everyday writing, how we take notes of what we encounterand what we do with them, will make all the difference for the moment we doface the blank page/screen – or rather not , as those who take smart notes willnever have the problem of a blank screen again.

There is another reason that note-taking flies mostly under the radar: Wedon’t experience any immediate negative feedback if we do it badly. Butwithout an immediate experience of failure, there is also not much demandfor help. And the publishing market working how it works, there is not muchhelp in supply for this lack of demand either. It is the panic in front of theblank screen that brings students and academic writers to turn to thebookshelves full of self-help books on writing, a market publishers meet indroves by focusing on how to deal with this horse-has-already-left-the-barnsituation. If we take notes unsystematically, inefficiently or simply wrong, wemight not even realise it until we are in the midst of a deadline panic andwonder why there always seem to be a few who get a lot of good writingdone and still have time for a coffee every time we ask them. And even then,it is more likely that some form of rationalization will cloud the view of theactual reason, which is most likely the difference between good and bad note-taking. “Some people are just like that,” “writing has to be difficult,” “thestruggle is part of the deal” are just a few of the mantras that keep too manyfrom inquiring what exactly distinguishes successful writing strategies fromless successful ones.

The right question is: What can we do differently in the weeks, months oreven years before we face the blank page that will get us into the bestpossible position to write a great paper easily? Very few people struggle with their papers because they don’t know how to cite correctly or because theysuffer from a psychological issue that keeps them from writing. Few struggleto text their friends or write emails. The rules of citation can be looked up andthere is no way that there are as many mental issues as papers postponed.Most people struggle for much more mundane reasons, and one is the mythof the blank page itself. They struggle because they believe, as they are madeto believe, that writing starts with a blank page. If you believe that you haveindeed nothing at hand to fill it, you have a very good reason to panic. Justhaving it all in your head is not enough, as getting it down on paper is thehard bit. That is why good, productive writing is based on good note-taking.Getting something that is already written into another written piece isincomparably easier than assembling everything in your mind and then tryingto retrieve it from there.

To sum it up: The quality of a paper and the ease with which it is writtendepends more than anything on what you have done in writing before youeven made a decision on the topic. But if that is true (and I wholeheartedlybelieve it is), and the key to successful writing lies in the preparation, it alsomeans that the vast majority of self-help books and study guides can onlyhelp you to close the barn door correctly and according to official rules – notjust a moment, but many months after the horse has already escaped.With that in mind, it is not surprising that the single most importantindicator of academic success is not to be found in people’s heads, but in theway they do their everyday work. In fact, there is no measurable correlationbetween a high IQ and academic success – at least not north of 120. Yes, acertain intellectual capacity helps to get into academia, and if you struggleseverely with an IQ test, it is likely that you will struggle to solve academicproblems, too. But once you are in, a superior IQ will neither help you todistinguish yourself nor protect you from failure. What does make asignificant difference along the whole intelligence spectrum is somethingelse: how much self-discipline or self-control one uses to approach the tasksat hand (Duckworth and Seligman, 2005; Tangney, Baumeister, and Boone,2004).

It is not so important who you are, but what you do. Doing the workrequired and doing it in a smart way leads, somehow unsurprisingly, tosuccess. At first glance, this is both good and bad news. The good news isthat we wouldn’t be able to do much about our IQ anyway, while it seems to be within our control to have more self-discipline with a little bit ofwillpower. The bad news is that we do not have this kind of control overourselves. Self-discipline or self-control is not that easy to achieve with willpower alone. Willpower is, as far as we know today,2 a limited resourcethat depletes quickly and is also not that much up for improvement over thelong term (Baumeister, Bratslavsky, Muraven, and Tice, 1998; Muraven,Tice, and Baumeister, 1998; Schmeichel, Vohs, and Baumeister, 2003;Moller, 2006). And who would want to flog oneself to work, anyway?Luckily, this is not the whole story. We know today that self-control andself-discipline have much more to do with our environment than withourselves (cf. Thaler, 2015, ch. 2) – and the environment can be changed.Nobody needs willpower not to eat a chocolate bar when there isn’t onearound. And nobody needs willpower to do something they wanted to doanyway. Every task that is interesting, meaningful and well-defined will bedone, because there is no conflict between long- and short-term interests.Having a meaningful and well-defined task beats willpower every time. Nothaving willpower, but not having to use willpower indicates that you setyourself up for success. This is where the organisation of writing and note-taking comes into play.

### 1 Everything You Need to Know

Until now, writing and note-taking techniques were usually taught withoutmuch regard to the overarching workflow. This book aims to change that. Itwill present you with the tools of note-taking that turned the son of a brewerinto one of the most productive and revered social scientists of the 20thcentury. But moreover, it describes how he implemented them into hisworkflow so he could honestly say: “I never force myself to do anything Idon’t feel like. Whenever I am stuck, I do something else.” A good structureallows you to do that, to move seamlessly from one task to another – withoutthreatening the whole arrangement or losing sight of the bigger picture.A good structure is something you can trust. It relieves you from theburden of remembering and keeping track of everything. If you can trust thesystem, you can let go of the attempt to hold everything together in your headand you can start focusing on what is important: The content, the argumentand the ideas. By breaking down the amorphous task of “writing a paper”into small and clearly separated tasks, you can focus on one thing at a time,complete each in one go and move on to the next one (Chapter 3.1). A goodstructure enables flow , the state in which you get so completely immersed inyour work that you lose track of time and can just keep on going as the workbecomes effortless (Csikszentmihalyi, 1975). Something like that does nothappen by chance.

As students, researchers and nonfiction writers, we have so much morefreedom than others to choose what we want to spend our time on. Still, weoften struggle the most with procrastination and motivation. It is certainly notthe lack of interesting topics, but rather the employment of problematic workroutines that seems to take charge of us instead of allowing us to steer theprocess in the right direction. A good, structured workflow puts us back incharge and increases our freedom to do the right thing at the right time.Having a clear structure to work in is completely different from makingplans about something. If you make a plan, you impose a structure onyourself ; it makes you inflexible. To keep going according to plan, you haveto push yourself and employ willpower. This is not only demotivating, butalso unsuitable for an open-ended process like research, thinking or studying in general, where we have to adjust our next steps with every new insight,understanding or achievement – which we ideally have on a regular basis andnot just as an exception. Even though planning is often at odds with the veryidea of research and learning, it is the mantra of most study guides and self-help books on academic writing. How do you plan for insight, which, bydefinition, cannot be anticipated? It is a huge misunderstanding that the onlyalternative to planning is aimless messing around. The challenge is tostructure one’s workflow in a way that insight and new ideas can become thedriving forces that push us forward. We do not want to make ourselvesdependent on a plan that is threatened by the unexpected, like a new idea,discovery – or insight.

Unfortunately, even universities try to turn students into planners. Sure,planning will get you through your exams if you stick to them and pushthrough. But it will not make you an expert in the art oflearning/writing/note-taking (there is research on that: cf. Chapter 1.3).Planners are also unlikely to continue with their studies after they finish theirexaminations. They are rather glad it is over. Experts, on the other hand,would not even consider voluntarily giving up what has already proved to berewarding and fun: learning in a way that generates real insight, isaccumulative and sparks new ideas. The fact that you invested in this booktells me that you would rather be an expert than a planner.And if you are a student seeking help with your writing, the chances arethat you already aim high too, because it is usually the best students whostruggle the most. Good students wrestle with their sentences because theycare about finding the right expression. It takes them longer to find a goodidea to write about because they know from experience that the first idea israrely that great and good questions do not fall into their laps. They spendmore time in the library to get a better overview of the literature, which leadsto more reading, which means that they have to juggle more information.Having read more does not automatically mean having more ideas. Especiallyin the beginning, it means having fewer ideas to work with, because youknow that others have already thought of most of them.

Good students also look beyond the obvious. They peek over the fences oftheir own disciplines – and once you have done that, you cannot go back anddo what everyone else is doing, even if you now must deal withheterogeneous ideas that come without a manual on how they might fit together. All that means is that a system is needed to keep track of the ever-increasing pool of information, which allows one to combine different ideasin an intelligent way with the aim of generating new ideas.Poor students do not have any of these problems. As long as they stickwithin the boundaries of their discipline and read only as much as they aretold to (or less), no serious external system is required and writing can bedone by sticking with the usual formulas of “how to write a scientific paper.”In fact, poor students often feel more successful (until they are tested),because they don’t experience much self-doubt. In psychology, this is knownas the Dunning-Kruger effect (Kruger and Dunning, 1999). Poor studentslack insight into their own limitations – as they would have to know about thevast amount of knowledge out there to be able to see how little they know incomparison. That means that those who are not very good at something tendto be overly confident, while those who have made an effort tend tounderestimate their abilities. Poor students also have no trouble finding aquestion to write about: they neither lack opinions nor the confidence thatthey have already thought them through. They also won’t have troublefinding confirming evidence in the literature as they usually lack both interestand skill to detect and think through dis-confirming facts and arguments.Good students, on the other hand, constantly raise the bar for themselves asthey focus on what they haven’t learned and mastered yet. This is why highachievers who have had a taste of the vast amount of knowledge out there arelikely to suffer from what psychologists call imposter syndrome, the feelingthat you are not really up to the job, even though, of all people, they are(Clance and Imes 1978; Brems et al. 1994). This book is for you, the goodstudents, ambitious academics and curious nonfiction writers who understandthat insight doesn’t come easy and that writing is not only for proclaimingopinions, but the main tool to achieve insight worth sharing.

#### _1.1 Good Solutions are Simple – and Unexpected_

There is no need to build a complex system and there is no need to reorganiseeverything you already have. You can start working and developing ideasimmediately by taking smart notes.

Complexity is an issue, though. Even if you don’t aim to develop a grandtheory and just want to keep track of what you read, organise your notes anddevelop your thoughts, you will have to deal with an increasingly complex body of content, especially because it is not just about collecting thoughts,but about making connections and sparking new ideas. Most people try toreduce complexity by separating what they have into smaller stacks, piles orseparate folders. They sort their notes by topics and sub-topics, which makesit look less complex, but quickly becomes very complicated. Plus, it reducesthe likelihood of building and finding surprising connections between thenotes themselves, which means a trade-off between its usability andusefulness.

Thankfully, we don’t have to choose between usability and usefulness.Quite the contrary. The best way to deal with complexity is to keep things assimple as possible and to follow a few basic principles. The simplicity of thestructure allows complexity to build up where we want it: on the contentlevel. There is quite extensive empirical and logical research on thisphenomenon (for an overview: cf. Sull and Eisenhardt, 2015). Taking smartnotes is as simple as it gets.

Another item of good news regards the amount of time and effort you haveto put into getting started. Even though you will change considerably the wayyou read, take notes and write, there is almost no preparation time needed(except for understanding the principle and installing one or two freeprograms). It is not about redoing what you have done before, but aboutchanging the way of working from now on. There is really no need toreorganise anything you already have. Just deal with things differently themoment you have to deal with them anyway.

There is more good news. There is no need to reinvent the wheel. We onlyneed to combine two well-known and proven ideas. The first idea lies at theheart of this book and is the technique of the simple slip-box. I will explainthe principle of this system in the next chapter and show how it can beimplemented in the everyday routines of students, academics or nonfictionwriters. Thankfully, there are digital versions for all major operating systemsavailable, but if you prefer, you can also use pen and paper. In terms ofproductivity and ease, you will still easily surpass those who are taking not-so-smart notes.

The second idea is equally important. Even the best tool will not improveyour productivity considerably if you don’t change your daily routines thetool is embedded in, just as the fastest car won’t help you much if you don’thave proper roads to drive it on. Like every change in behaviour, a change in working habits means going through a phase where you are drawn back toyour old ways. The new way of working might feel artificial at first and notnecessarily like what you intuitively would do. That is normal. But as soon asyou get used to taking smart notes, it will feel so much more natural that youwill wonder how you were ever able to get anything done before. Routinesrequire simple, repeatable tasks that can become automatic and fit togetherseamlessly (cf. Mata, Todd, and Lippke, 2010). Only when all the relatedwork becomes part of an overarching and interlocked process, where allbottlenecks are removed, can significant change take place (which is whynone of the typical “10 mind-blowing tools to improve your productivity”tips you can find all over the internet will ever be of much help).

The importance of an overarching workflow is the great insight of DavidAllen’s “Getting Things Done” (Allen, 2001). There are few seriousknowledge workers left who haven’t heard of “GTD” and that is for a goodreason: It works. The principle of GTD is to collect everything that needs tobe taken care of in one place and process it in a standardised way. Thisdoesn’t necessarily mean that we actually do everything we once intended todo, but it forces us to make clear choices and regularly check if our tasks stillfit into the bigger picture. Only if we know that everything is taken care of,from the important to the trivial, can we let go and focus on what is right infront of us. Only if nothing else is lingering in our working memory andtaking up valuable mental resources can we experience what Allen calls a“mind like water” - the state where we can focus on the work right in front ofus without getting distracted by competing thoughts. The principle is simplebut holistic. It is not a quick fix or a fancy tool. It doesn’t do the work foryou. But it does provide a structure for our everyday work that deals with thefact that most distractions do not come so much from our environment, butour own minds.

Unfortunately, David Allen’s technique cannot simply be transferred to thetask of insightful writing. The first reason is that GTD relies on clearlydefined objectives, whereas insight cannot be predetermined by definition.We usually start with rather vague ideas that are bound to change until theybecome clearer in the course of our research (cf. Ahrens, 2014, 134f.).Writing that aims at insight must therefore be organised in a much more openmanner. The other reason is that GTD requires projects to be broken downinto smaller, concrete “next steps.” Of course, insightful writing or academic work is also done one step at a time, but these are most often too small to beworth writing down (looking up a footnote, rereading a chapter, writing aparagraph) or too grand to be finished in one go. It is also difficult toanticipate which step has to be taken after the next one. You might notice afootnote, which you check quickly on. You try to understand a paragraph andneed to look up something for clarification. You make a note, go back toreading and then jump up to write down a sentence that formed itself in yourmind.

Writing is not a linear process. We constantly have to jump back and forthbetween different tasks. It wouldn’t make any sense to micromanageourselves on that level. Zooming out to the bigger picture does not reallyhelp, either, because then we have next steps like “writing a page.” That doesnot really help with navigating the things you have to do to write a page,often a whole bunch of other things that can take an hour or a month. One hasto navigate mostly by sight. These are probably the reasons why GTD neverreally caught on in academia, although it is very successful in business andhas a good reputation among the self-employed.

What we can take from Allen as an important insight is that the secret to asuccessful organization lies in the holistic perspective. Everything needs to betaken care of, otherwise the neglected bits will nag us until the unimportanttasks become urgent. Even the best tools won’t make much of a difference ifthey are used in isolation. Only if they are embedded in a well-conceivedworking process can the tools play out their strengths. There is no point inhaving great tools if they don’t fit together.

When it comes to writing, everything, from research to proofreading, isclosely connected. All the little steps must be linked in a way that will enableyou to go seamlessly from one task to another, but still be kept separateenough to enable us to flexibly do what needs to be done in any givensituation. And this is the other insight of David Allen: Only if you can trustyour system, only if you really know that everything will be taken care of,will your brain let go and let you focus on the task at hand.

That is why we need a note-taking system that is as comprehensive asGTD, but one that is suitable for the open-ended process of writing, learningand thinking. Enter the slip-box.

#### _1.2 The Slip-box_

It is the 1960s, somewhere in Germany. Among the staff of a Germanadministration office is the son of a brewer. His name is Niklas Luhmann. Hewent to law school, but he has chosen to be a public servant, as he did notlike the idea of having to work for multiple clients. Fully aware he is also notsuited for a career in administration, as it involves a lot of socializing, heexcuses himself every day after his 9-5 shift and goes home to do what heliked most: reading and following his diverse interests in philosophy,organizational theory and sociology.

Whenever he encountered something remarkable or had a thought aboutwhat he read, he made a note. Now, many people read in the evening andfollow their interests, and some even take notes. But for very few is it thepath to something as extraordinary as Luhmann’s career.

After collecting notes for a while in the way most people do, commentingin the margins of a text or collecting handwritten notes by topic, Luhmannrealised his note-taking was not leading anywhere. So he turned note-takingon its head. Instead of adding notes to existing categories or the respectivetexts, he wrote them all on small pieces of paper, put a number in the cornerand collected them in one place: the slip-box.

He soon developed new categories of these notes. He realised that oneidea, one note was only as valuable as its context, which was not necessarilythe context it was taken from. So he started to think about how one idea couldrelate and contribute to different contexts. Just amassing notes in one placewould not lead to anything other than a mass of notes. But he collected hisnotes in his slip-box in such a way that the collection became much morethan the sum of its parts. His slip-box became his dialogue partner, main ideagenerator and productivity engine. It helped him to structure and develop histhoughts. And it was fun to work with – because it worked.

And it led him to enter academia. One day, he put some of these thoughtstogether into a manuscript and handed it over to Helmut Schelsky, one of themost influential sociologists in Germany. Schelsky took it home, read whatthis academic outsider had written and contacted Luhmann. He suggested thathe should become a professor of sociology in the newly founded Universityof Bielefeld. As attractive and prestigious as this position was, Luhmannwasn’t a sociologist. He didn’t have the formal qualifications required evento become an assistant for a sociology professor in Germany. He hadn’twritten a habilitation, the highest academic qualification in many European countries, which is based on the second book after the doctoral thesis. He hadnever held a doctorate or even obtained a sociology degree. Most peoplewould take the offer as a huge compliment, but point out the impossibility ofit and move on.

Not Luhmann. He turned to his slip-box and with its help he put together adoctoral thesis and the habilitation thesis in less than a year – while takingclasses in sociology. Shortly after, in 1968, he was chosen to becomeprofessor of sociology at the University of Bielefeld – a position he wouldhold for the rest of his life.

In Germany, a professor traditionally starts with a public lecture presentinghis or her projects, and Luhmann, too, was asked what his main researchproject will be. His answer would become famous. He laconically stated:“My project: theory of society. Duration: 30 years. Costs: zero” (Luhmann,1997, 11). In sociology, a “theory of society” is the mother of all projects.When he finished the final chapter, almost exactly 29 and a half years later,as a two-volume book with the title “The Society of Society” (1997), it stirred up the scientific community.3 It was a radical new theory that notonly changed sociology, but stirred heated discussions in philosophy,education, political theory and psychology as well. Not everyone was able tofollow the discussions, though. What he did was unusually sophisticated,very different and highly complex. The chapters were published individually,each book discussing one social system. He wrote on law, politics, economy,communication, art, education, epistemology – and even love.

In 30 years, he published 58 books and hundreds of articles, translationsnot included. Many became classics in their respective fields. Even after hisdeath, about half a dozen more books on diverse subjects like religion,education or politics were published in his name – based on almost finishedmanuscripts lying around in his office. There are more than a few colleaguesI know who would give a lot to be as productive in their whole lifetime asLuhmann was after his death.

While some career-oriented academics try to squeeze as many publicationsout of one idea as possible, Luhmann seemed to do the opposite. Heconstantly generated more ideas than he was able to write down. His textsread as if he is trying to squeeze as much insight and as many ideas aspossible into one publication.

When he was asked if he missed anything in his life, he famouslyanswered: “If I want something, it’s more time. The only thing that really is anuisance is the lack of time.” (Luhmann, Baecker, and Stanitzek, 1987, 139)And while some academics let their assistants do the main work or have ateam that is writing the papers to which they add their names, Luhmannrarely had any assistance at all. The last assistant who worked for him sworeblind that the only help he was able to give was to spot a few typos in hismanuscripts here and there. Luhmann’s only real help was a housekeeperwho cooked for him and his children during the week, not that extraordinaryconsidering he had to raise three children on his own after his wife died early.Five warm meals a week of course do not explain the production of roughly60 influential books and countless articles.

After doing extensive research on Luhmann’s workflow, the Germansociologist Johannes F.K. Schmidt concluded his productivity could only beexplained by his unique working technique (Schmidt 2013, 168). Thattechnique has never been a secret – Luhmann was always open about it. Heregularly mentioned the slip-box as the reason for his productivity. From asearly as 1985, his standard answer to the question of how anyone could be soproductive was: “I, of course, do not think everything by myself. It happensmainly within the slip-box” (Luhmann, Baecker, and Stanitzek 1987, 142).But few gave the slip-box and the way he worked with it a closer look,dismissing his explanation as the modest understatement of a genius.His productivity is, of course, impressive. But what is even moreimpressive than the sheer number of publications or the outstanding qualityof his writing is the fact that he seemed to achieve all this with almost no realeffort. He not only stressed that he never forced himself to do something hedidn’t feel like, he even said: “I only do what is easy. I only write when Iimmediately know how to do it. If I falter for a moment, I put the matter asidemand do something else.” (Luhmann et al., 1987, 154f.)4

Until recently, almost no one really seemed to believe it. We are still soused to the idea that a great outcome requires great effort that we tend not tobelieve that a simple change in our work routines could not only make usmore productive, but the work also more fun. But doesn’t it make much moresense that the impressive body of work was produced not in spite of the facthe never made himself do anything he didn’t feel like, but because of it?

Even hard work can be fun as long as it is aligned with our intrinsic goals andwe feel in control. The problems arise when we set up our work in such aninflexible way that we can’t adjust it when things change and becomearrested in a process that seems to develop a life of its own.The best way to maintain the feeling of being in control is to stay incontrol. And to stay in control, it's better to keep your options open during thewriting process rather than limit yourself to your first idea. It is in the natureof writing, especially insight-oriented writing, that questions change, thematerial we work with turns out to be very different from the one imagined orthat new ideas emerge, which might change our whole perspective on whatwe do. Only if the work is set up in a way that is flexible enough to allowthese small and constant adjustments can we keep our interest, motivationand work aligned – which is the precondition to effortless or almost effortlesswork.

Luhmann was able to focus on the important things right in front of him,pick up quickly where he left off and stay in control of the process becausethe structure of his work allowed him to do this. If we work in anenvironment that is flexible enough to accommodate our work rhythm, wedon’t need to struggle with resistance. Studies on highly successful peoplehave proven again and again that success is not the result of strong willpowerand the ability to overcome resistance, but rather the result of smart workingenvironments that avoid resistance in the first place (cf. Neal et al. 2012;Painter et al. 2002; Hearn et al. 1998). Instead of struggling with adversedynamics, highly productive people deflect resistance, very much like judochampions. This is not just about having the right mindset, it is also abouthaving the right workflow. It is the way Luhmann and his slip-box workedtogether that allowed him to move freely and flexibly between different tasksand levels of thinking. It is about having the right tools and knowing how touse them – and very few understand that you need both.

People still search for Luhmann’s “secret,” putting down his remarkableoutput to him being a genius or even thinking they only need his slip-box andthey would be set. Sure, you need to be smart to be successful in academiaand writing, but if you don’t have an external system to think in and organiseyour thoughts, ideas and collected facts, or have no idea how to embed it inyour overarching daily routines, the disadvantage is so enormous that it justcan’t be compensated by a high IQ.

As far as the technology is concerned, there is no secret. It has all been inthe open for more than three decades now. So why is not everybody using aslip-box and working effortlessly towards success? Is it because it is toocomplicated? Certainly not. It is rather surprisingly simple. The reasons aremuch more mundane:

1. \*Until very recently, when the first results from the research on the filesystem were published, some crucial misunderstandings prevailed abouthow Luhmann actually worked, which led to disappointing results formany who tried to emulate the system. The main misunderstanding stemsfrom an isolated focus on the slip-box and a neglect of the actual workflowin which it is embedded.
2. Almost everything that is published about this system was only accessiblein German and was almost exclusively discussed within a small group ofdevoted sociologists who specialised in Luhmann’s theory of socialsystems – hardly the kind of critical mass that would draw much attention.
3. The third and maybe the most important reason is the very fact that it issimple. Intuitively, most people do not expect much from simple ideas.They rather assume that impressive results must have equally impressivelycomplicated means.

The contemporaries of Henry Ford did not understand why something assimple as the conveyor belt should be that revolutionary. What differencedoes it make to let the cars move from worker to worker instead of letting theworkers walk from car to car? I would not be surprised if some of them eventhought of Ford as a bit simpleminded and overly enthusiastic about a ratherminor change in work organization. It is only in hindsight that the scale of theadvantages of this small tweak became obvious to everyone. I wonder howlong it will take until the advantages of Luhmann’s slip-box and workroutines become equally obvious to everyone. But by then, everyone willalready have known it all along the way.

Whatever the reasons were: The word is out now and I wouldn’t besurprised if it spreads fast.

#### _1.3 The slip-box manual_

How does the slip-box, the heart of this system, work?

Strictly speaking, Luhmann had two slip-boxes: a bibliographical one,which contained the references and brief notes on the content of the literature,and the main one in which he collected and generated his ideas, mainly inresponse to what he read. The notes were written on index cards and stored inwooden boxes.

Whenever he read something, he would write the bibliographic informationon one side of a card and make brief notes about the content on the other side(Schmidt 2013, 170). These notes would end up in the bibliographic slip-box.In a second step, shortly after, he would look at his brief notes and thinkabout their relevance for his own thinking and writing. He then would turn tothe main slip-box and write his ideas, comments and thoughts on new piecesof paper, using only one for each idea and restricting himself to one side ofthe paper, to make it easier to read them later without having to take them outof the box. He kept them usually brief enough to make one idea fit on a singlesheet, but would sometimes add another note to extend a thought.

He usually wrote his notes with an eye towards already existing notes inthe slip-box. And while the notes on the literature were brief, he wrote themwith great care, not much different from his style in the final manuscript: infull sentences and with explicit references to the literature from which hedrew his material. More often than not, a new note would directly follow upon another note and would become part of a longer chain of notes. He thenwould add references to notes somewhere else in the slip-box, some of themwhich were located nearby, others in completely different areas and contexts.Some were directly related and read more like comments, others containednot-so-obvious connections. Rarely would a note stay in isolation.

He did not just copy ideas or quotes from the texts he read, but made atransition from one context to another. It was very much like a translationwhere you use different words that fit a different context, but strive to keepthe original meaning as truthfully as possible. Writing that an authorstruggles in one chapter to justify his method can be a much more adequatedescription of this chapter’s content than any quote from the text itself (thiswould call for an explanation, of course).

The trick is that he did not organise his notes by topic, but in the ratherabstract way of giving them fixed numbers. The numbers bore no meaningand were only there to identify each note permanently. If a new note wasrelevant or directly referred to an already existing note, such as a comment, correction or addition, he added it directly behind the previous note. If theexisting note had the number 22, the new note would become note number 23. \*If 23 already existed, he named the new note 22a. By alternating numbersand letters, with some slashes and commas in between, he was able to branchout into as many strings of thought as he liked. For example, a note aboutcausality and systems theory carried the number 21/3d7a7 following a notewith the number 21/3d7a6.

Whenever he added a note, he checked his slip-box for other relevant notesto make possible connections between them. Adding a note directly behindanother note is only one way of doing this. Another way is by adding a linkon this and/or the other note, which could be anywhere in the system. Thisvery much resembles, of course, the way we use hyperlinks on the internet.But, as I will explain later, they are quite different and it would be rathermisleading to think of his slip-box as a personal Wikipedia or a database onpaper. The similarities are obviously there, but the subtle differences are what makes this system unique.

By adding these links between notes, Luhmann was able to add the samenote to different contexts. While other systems start with a preconceivedorder of topics, Luhmann developed topics bottom up, then added anothernote to his slip-box, on which he would sort a topic by sorting the links of therelevant other notes.

The last element in his file system was an index, from which he wouldrefer to one or two notes that would serve as a kind of entry point into a lineof thought or topic. Notes with a sorted collection of links are, of course,good entry points.

That’s it. Actually, it is even simpler than this, as we now have softwarethat makes it much easier (cf. chapter 1.3): we don’t need to manually add numbers on notes or cut out paper as Luhmann had to.5

Now that you know how the slip-box works, you only need to understandhow to work with it. And the best way to understand this is to understand alittle bit about the way we think, learn and develop ideas. And if I wereforced to boil it down to a single bullet point, it would be this: We need areliable and simple external structure to think in that compensates for thelimitations of our brains. But first, let me guide you through the process ofwriting a paper with the slip-box.

### \*2 Everything You Need to Do

Imagine you do not start with a clean sheet. Imagine instead some friendlygenie (or well-paid personal assistant – whatever is more likely for you tohave available) prepared a rough draft of your paper for you. It is already afully developed argument including all references, quotes and some reallysmart ideas. The only thing left to do is to revise this rough draft and send itoff. Make no mistake: there is still work to do and it is more than just findingsome typos. Editing is work that needs focus. You have to rephrase somesentences, delete one or two redundancies and maybe add a couple ofsentences or even passages to fill some holes left in the argument. But at thesame time, it is a well-defined task: nothing that couldn’t be done within afew days and certainly nothing you would have trouble motivating yourself todo: Everybody is motivated when the finish line is within reach. No problemso far.

Imagine now you are not the one who has to edit the rough draft and turn itinto the final paper, but the one who has to prepare it. What would be helpfulto achieve that quickly? It would certainly make things a lot easier if youalready had everything you need right in front of you: The ideas, thearguments, the quotes, long developed passages, complete with bibliographyand references. And not just readily available, but already in order, sorted bychapters that have descriptive headlines. Now that’s also a clear assignment.No worries about perfect sentences (someone else will take care of that), noworries about finding things and coming up with ideas (someone else alreadytook care of that), you just focus on turning a string of ideas into a continuoustext. Again, that is still serious work and you have to put some effort into it, ifyou want to make it great. You might spot a missing step in an argument andhave to fill it, or you might want to rearrange some notes or leave somethingout that you regard as less relevant. But, again, this is not an overwhelmingtask and luckily, it doesn’t need to be perfect. No problem so far.

Equally manageable is the task of bringing already existing notes intoorder, especially if half of them already are in order. Searching through a filesystem with strings of discussions, plenty of material and ideas is, believe itor not, fun. It does not require the kind of focused attention you would needto formulate a sentence or to understand a difficult text. Your attention is rather at ease and it even helps to have a playful mindset. Only with a lessnarrow focus will you be able to see connections and patterns. You seeclearly where long strings of discussions have already been built up – this is agood starting point. If you do look for specific notes, you have an index toturn to. No problem at all so far.

At this point, it should become clear that you don’t need to wait for a genieto appear, as each step is clearly not only within your abilities, but alsostraightforward and well defined: Assemble notes and bring them into order,turn these notes into a draft, review it and you are done.

Now, that’s all well and good, you might say, but what about writing thesenotes? Obviously, it is easy to write a paper if the main part of the writing isalready done and only needs to be turned into a linear text. But isn’t that alittle bit like saying: If you are short of money, just take what you need out ofyour piggy bank? Everyone can make things look easy by leaving out themain part. So, where is the genie for that?

Granted, writing these notes is the main work. It will take enormousamounts of effort, time, patience and willpower, and you will probably breakunder the weight of this task. Just kidding. It is the easiest part of all. Writingthese notes is also not the main work. Thinking is. Reading is. Understandingand coming up with ideas is. And this is how it is supposed to be. The notesare just the tangible outcome of it. All you have to do is to have a pen in yourhand while you are doing what you are doing anyway (or a keyboard underyour fingers). Writing notes accompanies the main work and, done right, ithelps with it. Writing is, without dispute, the best facilitator for thinking,reading, learning, understanding and generating ideas we have. Notes buildup while you think, read, understand and generate ideas, because you have tohave a pen in your hand if you want to think, read, understand and generateideas properly anyway. If you want to learn something for the long run, youhave to write it down. If you want to really understand something, you haveto translate it into your own words. Thinking takes place as much on paper asin your own head. “Notes on paper, or on a computer screen ... do not makecontemporary physics or other kinds of intellectual endeavour easier, theymake it possible,” neuroscientist Neil Levy concludes in the introduction tothe Oxford Handbook of Neuroethics, summarizing decades of research.Neuroscientists, psychologists and other experts on thinking have verydifferent ideas about how our brains work, but, as Levy writes: “no matter how internal processes are implemented, (you) need to understand the extentto which the mind is reliant upon external scaffolding.” (2011, 270) If there isone thing the experts agree on, then it is this: You have to externalise yourideas, you have to write. Richard Feynman stresses it as much as BenjaminFranklin. If we write, it is more likely that we understand what we read,remember what we learn and that our thoughts make sense. And if we have towrite anyway, why not use our writing to build up the resources for our futurepublications?

Thinking, reading, learning, understanding and generating ideas is the mainwork of everyone who studies, does research or writes. If you write toimprove all of these activities, you have a strong tailwind going for you. Ifyou take your notes in a smart way, it will propel you forward.

#### _2.1 Writing a paper step by step_

\*1. Make fleeting notes. Always have something at hand to write with tocapture every idea that pops into your mind. Don’t worry too much abouthow you write it down or what you write it on. These are fleeting notes, merereminders of what is in your head. They should not cause any distraction. Putthem into one place, which you define as your inbox, and process them later.I usually have a simple notebook with me, but I am happy with napkins orreceipts if nothing else is at hand. Sometimes I leave a voice record on myphone. If your thoughts are already sorted and you have the time, you canskip this step and write your idea directly down as a proper, permanent notefor your slip-box.

*2. Make literature notes. Whenever you read something, make notes aboutthe content. Write down what you don’t want to forget or think you might usein your own thinking or writing. Keep it very short, be extremely selective,and use your own words. Be extra selective with quotes – don’t copy them toskip the step of really understanding what they mean. Keep these notestogether with the bibliographic details in one place – your reference system.
*3. Make permanent notes. Now turn to your slip-box. Go through the notesyou made in step one or two (ideally once a day and before you forget whatyou meant) and think about how they relate to what is relevant for your ownresearch, thinking or interests. This can soon be done by looking into the slip-box – it only contains what interests you anyway. The idea is not to collect, but to develop ideas, arguments and discussions. Does the new informationcontradict, correct, support or add to what you already have (in the slip-boxor on your mind)? Can you combine ideas to generate something new? Whatquestions are triggered by them?

Write exactly one note for each idea and write as if you were writing forsomeone else: Use full sentences, disclose your sources, make references andtry to be as precise, clear and brief as possible. Throw away the fleeting notesfrom step one and put the literature notes from step two into your referencesystem. You can forget about them now. All that matters is going into theslip-box.

\*4. Now add your new permanent notes to the slip-box by:

A. Filing each one behind one or more related notes (with a program, you
can put one note “behind” multiple notes; if you use pen and paper like
Luhmann, you have to decide where it fits best and add manual links to
the other notes). Look to which note the new one directly relates or, if it
does not relate directly to any other note yet, just file it behind the last
one.
B. Adding links to related notes.
C. Making sure you will be able to find this note later by either linking to it
from your index or by making a link to it on a note that you use as an
entry point to a discussion or topic and is itself linked to the index.

*5. Develop your topics, questions and research projects bottom up fromwithin the system. See what is there, what is missing and what questionsarise. Read more to challenge and strengthen your arguments and change anddevelop your arguments according to the new information you are learningabout. Take more notes, develop ideas further and see where things will takeyou. Just follow your interest and always take the path that promises the mostinsight. Build upon what you have. Even if you don’t have anything in yourslip-box yet, you never start from scratch – you already have ideas on yourmind to be tested, opinions to be challenged and questions to be answered.Do not brainstorm for a topic. Look into the slip-box instead to see wherechains of notes have developed and ideas have been built up to clusters.Don’t cling to an idea if another, more promising one gains momentum. Themore you become interested in something, the more you will read and think about it, the more notes you will collect and the more likely it is that you willgenerate questions from it. It might be exactly what you were interested infrom the beginning, but it is more likely that your interests will have changed - *that is what insight does.

\*6. After a while, you will have developed ideas far enough to decide on atopic to write about. Your topic is now based on what you have , not based onan unfounded idea about what the literature you are about to read mightprovide. Look through the connections and collect all the relevant notes onthis topic (most of the relevant notes will already be in partial order), copy them onto your “desktop”6 and bring them in order. Look for what ismissing and what is redundant. Don’t wait until you have everythingtogether. Rather, try ideas out and give yourself enough time to go back toreading and note-taking to improve your ideas, arguments and their structure.

\*7. Turn your notes into a rough draft. Don’t simply copy your notes into amanuscript. Translate them into something coherent and embed them into thecontext of your argument while you build your argument out of the notes atthe same time. Detect holes in your argument, fill them or change yourargument.

\*8. Edit and proofread your manuscript. Give yourself a pat on the shoulderand turn to the next manuscript.

These are the steps, presented as if you will write only one paper/article at atime. In reality, you never work on just one idea, but many ideas in differentstages at the same time. And that is where the system plays out its realstrengths. We cannot help but think about more than one question at a timeand the chances are that you will think and write in the future as well. Itmight not be for academia or a publication, but certainly for your ownintellectual growth. Gather what you encounter along your way and don’t letany good idea go to waste. You might read a certain book in hope it could beuseful for one of the papers you write. Maybe you are wrong, but it stillmight contain some interesting thoughts worth keeping and useful forsomething else you haven’t thought about yet.

In truth, it is highly unlikely that every text you read will contain exactlythe information you looked for and nothing else. Otherwise, you must havealready known what was in there and wouldn’t have had reason to read it in the first place.7 As the only way to find out if something is worth reading isby reading it (even just bits of it), it makes sense to use the time spent in thebest possible way. We constantly encounter interesting ideas along the wayand only a fraction of them are useful for the particular paper we startedreading it for. Why let them go to waste? Make a note and add it to your slip-box. It improves it. Every idea adds to what can become a critical mass thatturns a mere collection of ideas into an idea-generator.

A typical work day will contain many, if not all, of these steps: You readand take notes. You build connections within the slip-box, which in itself willspark new ideas. You write them down and add them to the discussion. Youwrite on your paper, notice a hole in the argument and have another look inthe file system for the missing link. You follow up on a footnote, go back toresearch and might add a fitting quote to one of your papers in the making.How focused you want to read depends on your priorities. You don’t haveto read anything you don’t consider an absolute necessity for finishing yourmost urgent paper, but you will still encounter a lot of other ideas andinformation along the way. Spending the little extra time to add them to yoursystem will make all the difference, because the accidental encounters makeup the majority of what we learn.

Imagine if we went through life learning only what we planned to learn orbeing explicitly taught. I doubt we would have even learned to speak. Eachadded bit of information, filtered only by our interest, is a contribution to ourfuture understanding, thinking and writing. And the best ideas are usually theones we haven’t anticipated anyway.

Most people follow different lines of thought at the same time. They mightfocus for a while on one idea, but then leave it alone for another while untilthey see how to proceed further. It is helpful then to be able to pick up onanother idea now and go back to the earlier thought later. It is much morerealistic to keep this flexibility and you don’t have to worry about starting allover.

### \*3 Everything You Need to Have

There is this story where NASA tried to figure out how to make a ballpointpen that works in space. If you have ever tried to use a ballpoint pen overyour head, you have probably realised it is gravity that keeps the ink flowing.After a series of prototypes, several test runs and tons of money invested,NASA developed a fully functional gravity-independent pen, which pushesthe ink onto the paper by means of compressed nitrogen. According to thisstory, the Russians faced the same problem. So they used pencils (De Bono,1998, 141). The slip-box follows the Russian model: Focus on the essentials,don’t complicate things unnecessarily.

Academic writing in itself is not a complicated process that requires avariety of complicated tools, but is in constant danger of being clogged withunnecessary distractions. Unfortunately, most students collect and embraceover time a variety of learning and note-taking techniques, each promising tomake something easier, but combined have the opposite effect.The whole workflow becomes complicated: There is the technique ofunderlining important sentences (sometimes in different colours or shapes),commenting in the margins of a text, writing excerpts, employing reading methods with acronyms like SQ3R8 or SQ4R,9 writing a journal,brainstorming a topic or following multi-step question sheets – and then thereare, of course, the one thousand and twelve apps and programs that aresupposed to help with learning and writing. Few of these techniques areparticularly complicated in themselves, but they are usually used without anyregard to the actual workflow, which then quickly becomes a mess. Asnothing really fits together, working within this arrangement becomesextremely complicated indeed and difficult to get anything done.And if you stumble upon one idea and think that it might connect toanother idea, what do you do when you employ all these differenttechniques? Go through all your books to find the right underlined sentence?Reread all your journals and excerpts? And what do you do then? Write anexcerpt about it? Where do you save it and how does this help to make newconnections? Every little step suddenly turns into its own project withoutbringing the whole much further forward. Adding another promisingtechnique to it, then, would make things only worse.

That is why the slip-box is not introduced as another technique, but as acrucial element in an overarching workflow that is stripped of everything thatcould distract from what is important. Good tools do not add features andmore options to what we already have, but help to reduce distractions fromthe main work, which here is thinking. The slip-box provides an externalscaffold to think in and helps with those tasks our brains are not very good at,most of all objective storage of information.

That is pretty much it. To have an undistracted brain to think with and areliable collection of notes to think in is pretty much all we need. Everythingelse is just clutter.

#### _3.1 The Tool Box_

We need four tools:

· Something to write with and something to write on (pen and paper will
do)
· A reference management system (the best programs are free)
· The slip-box (the best program is free)
· An editor (whatever works best for you: very good ones are free)

More is unnecessary, less is impossible.

1. \*You need something to capture ideas whenever and wherever they popinto your head. Whatever you use, it should not require any thoughts,attention or multiple steps to write it down. It can be a notebook, a napkin,an app on your phone or iPad. These notes are not meant to be storedpermanently. They will be deleted or chucked soon anyway. They onlyfunction as a reminder of a thought and are not meant to capture thethought itself, which requires time to phrase proper sentences and checkfacts. I recommend having pen and paper with you at all times. It is reallyhard to beat a notebook in its simplicity. If you use other tools, make sureeverything ends up in one place, a central inbox or something like that,where you can process it soon, ideally within a day.

2. The reference system has two purposes: To collect the references (duh)and the notes you take during your reading. I strongly recommend using afree program like Zotero, which allows you to make new entries via browser plugins or just by entering the ISBN or digital object identifier
   (DOI) number. Zotero also can be integrated into Microsoft Word,
   OpenOffice, LibreOffice and NeoOffice, which allows you to insert
   quotations without actually typing in the reference. That not only makes
   things easier, you also mitigate the risk of messing things up when you
   add, edit or delete additional references. You can also easily change the
   format according to the standards required by your professors or the
   journal you write for. You can add notes to each entry – but it would also
   be fine to write your notes by hand and link them to the reference if you
   prefer to write by hand at this stage. In that case, just give the notes a
   standardised title like “AuthorYear” and keep them in alphabetical order in
   one place. You can download Zotero for free at zotero.org (Windows, Mac
   and Linux). You will find the links to all recommended programs on
   takesmartnotes.com.[10] If you prefer or already work with another,
   equally simple program, there is no reason not to use that.

3. \*The slip-box. Some prefer the old-fashioned pen and paper version in awooden box. That's fine – computers can only speed up a relatively minorpart of the work anyway, like adding links and formatting references. Theycan’t speed up the main part of the work, which is thinking, reading andunderstanding. All you would need are sheets of paper about the size of apostcard (Luhmann used the DIN A6 size, 148 x 105 mm or 5.83 x 4.13inches) and a box to keep them in. And even though there are clear benefitsof handwriting (cf. below chapter 3.2.1), I recommend using the digitalversion, if only for mobility. Even though you could basically emulate theslip-box with any program that allows setting links and tagging (likeEvernote or a Wiki), I strongly recommend using Daniel Lüdecke’sZettelkasten. It is the only program I know that really implements theprinciples behind Luhmann’s system and is at the same time simple andeasy to use. It is free and available for different operating systems. You candownload it from zettelkasten.danielluedecke.de (please consider sending adonation to the developer if you like it).

4. Finally, the editor: If you use Zotero, I recommend using one of theeditors it is compatible with (Microsoft Word, OpenOffice, LibreOffice orNeoOffice), because it makes life a lot easier if you don’t have to type inevery reference manually. Except for that, everything works fine – no editor can improve an argument.

If you have pen and paper, an editor, your slip-box and reference system athand, you are ready to go.

### \*4 A Few Things to Keep in Mind

Getting the tools ready shouldn’t have taken more than 5-10 minutes. Buthaving the right tools is only one part of the equation. It is easy to get fooledby their simplicity. Many “tried them out” without really understanding howto work with them and were expectedly disappointed with the results. Toolsare only as good as your ability to work with them. Everybody knows how tohandle a flute (you blow into one end and press your fingers on the holesaccording to the notes you are playing), but nobody would try it out once and
then judge the instrument on what they hear.11

But with tools like the slip-box, we sometimes forget that the handling is asimportant as the possibilities of the tool itself. If we try to use a tool withoutputting any thought into the way we work with it, even the best tool wouldnot be of much help. The slip-box, for example, would most likely be used asan archive for notes – or worse: a graveyard for thoughts (cf. Hollier 2005, 40on Mallarmé’s index cards). Unfortunately, there are quite a few explanationsof Luhmann’s technique on the Internet that focus in a misleading way on thetechnicalities of the slip-box. This has led to plenty of misconceptions aboutits abilities. But things are changing: Luhmann’s slip-box is currently theobject of a long-term research project at the University of Bielefeld, and theirfirst results have already given us a comprehensive understanding about howLuhmann really worked with it. You can look up for yourself some of his notes on their website.12 Soon, you will be able to access the wholedigitalised slip-box online. Add to this understanding recent psychologicalinsights about learning, creativity and thinking, and we also get a pretty goodpicture why it works. And it is indeed crucially important not only to knowhow it works or how to work with it, but also why it works. Only then willyou be able to tweak it for your own needs. And this is what this book is for:To give you all the resources you need to work in the best possible way withthe best technique available. By keeping just a few basic principles in mindand with an understanding of the logic behind the file system, I see no reasonwhy anyone should not be able to replicate Luhmann’s formula for successfullearning, writing and research.

## THE FOUR UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES

### 5 Writing Is the Only Thing That Matters

For students, the need for writing mainly appears in the form of examination.In this understanding, the written work represents a preceded performance,namely learning, understanding and the ability to analyse other textscritically. By writing, students demonstrate what they have learned, showtheir ability to think critically and ability to develop ideas. Thisunderstanding is related to the idea that students prepare for independentresearch. In this mindset, the writing of a paper is just another skill to belearned. It is compartmentalised from the other tasks – it is seen as one taskamong others. Students should not only learn to write papers, but also learnfacts, be able to discuss their ideas in seminars and listen carefully to lectures.Writing papers is seen as a task in itself with a beginning and an end. Almostall books written on academic writing start from this assumption. And almostall of them proceed accordingly, describing an idealised process in certainconsecutive steps.

First, the task to write is given, then there is the challenge to find a topic ora specific angle on a problem, the research to do, starting with the collectionof the relevant literature, followed by reading the material, processing it andcoming to a conclusion. Writing is what follows: In the beginning stands thequestion to be answered, followed by an overview of the literature, thediscussion of it and the conclusion. This, according to this thinking, preparesyou for doing independent research. Alas, it does not. If you becomesuccessful in your research, it was not because you learned to approachwriting in this way, but despite it.

This book is based on another assumption: Studying does not preparestudents for independent research. It is independent research. Nobody startsfrom scratch and everybody is already able to think for themselves. Studying,done properly, is research, because it is about gaining insight that cannot beanticipated and will be shared within the scientific community under publicscrutiny. There is no such thing as private knowledge in academia. An ideakept private is as good as one you never had. And a fact no one can reproduceis no fact at all. Making something public always means to write it down so itcan be read. There is no such thing as a history of unwritten ideas.

School is different. Pupils are usually not encouraged to follow their ownlearning paths, question and discuss everything the teacher is teaching andmove on to another topic if something does not promise to generateinteresting insight. The teacher is there for the pupils to learn. But, asWilhelm von Humboldt, founder of the Humboldt University of Berlin andbrother to the great explorer Alexander von Humboldt, put it, the professor isnot there for the student and the student not for the professor. Both are onlythere for the truth. And truth is always a public matter. Everything within theuniversity aims at some kind of publication. A written piece does notnecessarily need to be accepted in an international journal to become public.In fact, the vast majority of what is written and discussed is not published inthis narrow sense. The review process itself is a form of presenting an ideapublicly to the peers and so is everything a student hands over to a professoror lecturer. Even the handout for a presentation discussed with fellowstudents is a written piece made public. It is public because in the discussion,it does not matter anymore what the author meant , only what is there inwriting. The moment the author can be removed from the scene, the writtenpiece is a public claim on truth. The criteria for a convincing argument arealways the same, regardless of who the author is or the status of thepublisher: They have to be coherent and based on facts. Truth does notbelong to anyone; it is the outcome of the scientific exchange of writtenideas. This is why the presentation and the production of knowledge cannotbe separated, but are rather two sides of the same coin (Peters and Schäfer2006, 9). If writing is the medium of research and studying nothing else thanresearch, then there is no reason not to work as if nothing else counts thanwriting.

Working as if nothing else counts than writing does not mean spendingmore time writing at the expense of everything else. Only if wecompartmentalise our work into different, isolated tasks will it seem likefocusing on writing reduces the time we spend on other tasks. But it does notmean to read less, for this is the main source of the writing material. Itdoesn’t mean to attend fewer lectures or seminars, because they provide youwith the ideas to write about and questions worth answering. Attendinglectures is also one of the best ways to get an idea about the current state ofresearch, not to mention the ability to ask and discuss questions. Focusing onwriting also doesn’t mean to stop giving presentations or finding other ways of making your thoughts public. Where else could you get feedback for yourideas?

Focusing on writing as if nothing else counts does not necessarily meanyou should do everything else less well, but it certainly makes you doeverything else differently. Having a clear, tangible purpose when you attenda lecture, discussion or seminar will make you more engaged and sharpenyour focus. You will not waste your time with the attempt to figure out whatyou “should” learn. Rather, you will try to learn as efficiently as possible soyou can quickly get to the point where actual open questions arise, as theseare the only questions worth writing about. You quickly learn to distinguishgood-sounding arguments from actual good ones, as you will have to thinkthem through whenever you try to write them down and connect them withyour previous knowledge. It will change the way you read as well: You willbecome more focused on the most relevant aspects, knowing that you cannotwrite down everything. You will read in a more engaged way, because youcannot rephrase anything in your own words if you don’t understand what itis about. By doing this, you will elaborate on the meaning, which will make itmuch more likely that you will remember it. You also have to think beyondthe things you read, because you need to turn it into something new. And bydoing everything with the clear purpose of writing about it, you will do whatyou do deliberately. Deliberate practice is the only serious way of becomingbetter at what we are doing (cf. Anders Ericsson, 2008). If you change yourmind about the importance of writing, you will also change your mind abouteverything else. Even if you decide never to write a single line of amanuscript, you will improve your reading, thinking and other intellectualskills just by doing everything as if nothing counts other than writing.

### 6 Simplicity Is Paramount

We tend to think that big transformations have to start with an equally bigidea. But more often than not, it is the simplicity of an idea that makes it sopowerful (and often overlooked in the beginning). Boxes, for example, aresimple. Malcom McLean, the owner of a trucking company and a formertrucker himself, regularly got stuck in traffic on the crowded coastalhighways. When he came up with an idea to circumvent the congested roads,it was a simple one. He had no clue that it would tip the world in a newdirection. He did not foresee that his simple idea would reshape the politicallandscape, let some nations rise to the top and other fall behind, makecentury-old professions redundant, give birth to new industries, and wouldbarely leave a single person on earth unaffected by it. I am speaking, ofcourse, of the shipping container, which is basically just a box. WhenMcLean converted the tanker Ideal X to be able to carry 58 containers and setit to sail on 26 April 1956, it was just because it made more sense to shipparts of a lorry than the whole lorry itself, which in itself made more sensethan to have them stand in traffic for days. He certainly did not aim to turnworld trade upside down and pave the way for Asia to become the next bigeconomic power. He just didn’t want to get stuck in traffic anymore.It wasn’t just that nobody foresaw the impact of something as simple asthis box. Most ship owners had in fact considered the idea of putting differentkinds of products into the same sized boxes as fairly abstruse. Experiencedstevedores were able to use the storage room on a ship optimally by arrangingand fitting the goods, and every good came in its optimal package. Whyreplace it with an obviously less optimal solution? And speaking ofsuboptimal, why would anyone want to try to fit square boxes into a round-shaped ship body anyway? Ship owners also didn’t have many customerswho wanted to ship exactly the amount that fit into a container. That eitherleft customers unhappy or containers half empty or filled with goods fromdifferent customers, which meant that you had to unpack and rearrange thecontainers to untangle different orders in every single harbour. That did notsound very efficient to the ears of experienced shippers. And then you hadthe problem with the boxes themselves. Once unloaded and sent off on trucks, you had to find a way to get them back. McLean lost hundreds of containers this way. It was a logistical nightmare.

And by the way: McLean wasn’t the only one who had the idea to usecontainers on ships. Many others tried it, too, and almost all gave up on theidea soon after – not because they were too stubborn to accept a great idea,but because they lost too much money on it (Levinson, 2006, 45f). The ideawas simple, but it wasn’t easy to put it efficiently into practice.In hindsight, we know why they failed: The ship owners tried to integratethe container into their usual way of working without changing theinfrastructure and their routines. They tried to benefit from the obvioussimplicity of loading containers onto ships without letting go of what theywere used to. In the beginning, the perception was very much shaped by whatworked before, and only the most immediate effects were visible. The shipowners looked at the bags and crates of goods and wondered why they shouldpack them a second time into another box. They were glad when theyunloaded their goods at the harbour and they were eager to move on. Theywondered why they should go container-hunting instead. They looked at theships they had and wondered how to fit containers into them. McLeanunderstood better than others that it is not the perspective of the ship-ownersthat counts, but the purpose of the whole trade: to bring goods from theproducer to the final destination. Only after aligning every single part of thedelivery chain, from packaging to delivery, from the design of the ships to thedesign of the harbours, was the full potential of the container unleashed.When the advantages became obvious, second-order effects came into playand went into a self-reinforcing positive feedback loop. The more harbourswere able to handle containers, the more container ships were needed to bebuilt, which made shipping cheaper, which increased the range of goodsworth shipping, which created more traffic, which made bigger containerships economical, which created more demand for infrastructure and so on. Itwasn’t just another way of shipping goods. It was a whole new way of doingbusiness.

Many students and academic writers think like the early ship owners whenit comes to note-taking. They handle their ideas and findings in the way itmakes immediate sense: If they read an interesting sentence, they underlineit. If they have a comment to make, they write it into the margins. If theyhave an idea, they write it into their notebook, and if an article seems important enough, they make the effort and write an excerpt. Working likethis will leave you with a lot of different notes in many different places.Writing, then, means to rely heavily on your brain to remember where andwhen these notes were written down. A text must then be conceptualisedindependently from these notes, which explains why so many resort tobrainstorming to arrange the resources afterwards according to thispreconceived idea. In this textual infrastructure, this so-often-taughtworkflow, it indeed does not make much sense to rewrite these notes and putthem into a box, only to take them out again later when a certain quote orreference is needed during writing and thinking.

In the old system, the question is: Under which topic do I store this note?In the new system, the question is: In which context will I want to stumbleupon it again? Most students sort their material by topic or even by seminarsand semester. From the perspective of someone who writes, that makes asmuch sense as sorting your errands by purchase date and the store they werebought from. Can’t find your trousers? Maybe they are with the bleach youbought the same day at your department store.

The slip-box is the shipping container of the academic world. Instead ofhaving different storage for different ideas, everything goes into the sameslip-box and is standardised into the same format. Instead of focusing on thein-between steps and trying to make a science out of underlining systems,reading techniques or excerpt writing, everything is streamlined towards onething only: insight that can be published. The biggest advantage compared toa top-down storage system organised by topics is that the slip-box becomesmore and more valuable the more it grows, instead of getting messy andconfusing. If you sort by topic, you are faced with the dilemma of eitheradding more and more notes to one topic, which makes them increasinglyhard to find, or adding more and more topics and subtopics to it, which onlyshifts the mess to another level. The first system is designed to find thingsyou deliberately search for, putting all the responsibility on your brain. Theslip-box is designed to present you with ideas you have already forgotten,allowing your brain to focus on thinking instead of remembering.

Even though the slip-box, being organised bottom-up, does not face thetrade-off problem between too many or too few topics, it too can lose itsvalue when notes are added to it indiscriminately. It can only play out itsstrengths when we aim for a critical mass , which depends not only on the number of notes, but also their quality and the way they are handled.To achieve a critical mass, it is crucial to distinguish clearly between threetypes of notes:

1. \*Fleeting notes , which are only reminders of information, can be written inany kind of way and will end up in the trash within a day or two.
2. Permanent notes , which will never be thrown away and contain thenecessary information in themselves in a permanently understandable way.They are always stored in the same way in the same place, either in thereference system or, written as if for print, in the slip-box.
3. Project notes , which are only relevant to one particular project. They arekept within a project-specific folder and can be discarded or archived afterthe project is finished.

Only if the notes of these three categories are kept separated it will bepossible to build a critical mass of ideas within the slip-box. One of the majorreasons for not getting much writing or publishing done lies in the confusionof these categories.

A typical mistake is made by many diligent students who are adhering tothe advice to keep a scientific journal. A friend of mine does not let any idea,interesting finding or quote he stumbles upon dwindle away and writeseverything down. He always carries a notebook with him and often makes afew quick notes during a conversation. The advantage is obvious: No ideaever gets lost. The disadvantages are serious, though: As he treats every noteas if it belongs to the “permanent” category, the notes will never build up acritical mass. The collection of good ideas is diluted to insignificance by allthe other notes, which are only relevant for a specific project or actually notthat good on second sight. On top of that, the strict chronological order doesnot offer any help to find, combine or rearrange ideas in a productive sense. Itis not surprising that my friend has a bookshelf filled with notebooks full ofwonderful ideas, but not a single publication to show.

The second typical mistake is to collect notes only related to specificprojects. On first sight, it makes much more sense. You decide on what youare going to write about and then collect everything that helps you to do that.The disadvantage is that you have to start all over after each project and cutoff all other promising lines of thought. That means that everything you found, thought or encountered during the time of a project will be lost. If youtry to mitigate the effect by opening a new folder for every potential newproject whenever you stumble upon something that might be interesting forthat, you will soon end up with an overwhelming amount of unfinishedprojects. If that in itself does not become a drag on your motivation, the taskof keeping track of them will. But most importantly, without a permanentreservoir of ideas, you will not be able to develop any major ideas over alonger period of time because you are restricting yourself either to the lengthof a single project or the capacity of your memory. Exceptional ideas needmuch more than that.

The third typical mistake is, of course, to treat all notes as fleeting ones.You can easily spot this approach by the mess that comes with it, or rather bythe cycle of slowly growing piles of material followed by the impulse formajor clean-ps. Just collecting unprocessed fleeting notes inevitably leads tochaos. Even small amounts of unclear and unrelated notes lingering aroundyour desk will soon induce the wish of starting from scratch.

What all these category-confusing approaches have in common is that thebenefit of note-taking decreases with the number of notes you keep. Morenotes will make it more difficult to retrieve the right ones and bring relatedones together in a playful way. But it should be just the opposite: The moreyou learn and collect, the more beneficial your notes should become, themore ideas can mingle and give birth to new ones – and the easier it shouldbe to write an intelligent text with less effort.

It is important to reflect on the purpose of these different types of notes.Fleeting notes are there for capturing ideas quickly while you are busy doingsomething else. When you are in a conversation, listing to a lecture, hearsomething noteworthy or an idea pops into your mind while you are runningerrands, a quick note is the best you can do without interrupting what you arein the middle of doing. That might even apply to reading, if you want to focuson a text without interrupting your reading flow. Then you might want to justunderline sentences or write short comments in the margins. It is important tounderstand, though, that underlining sentences or writing comments in themargins are also just fleeting notes and do nothing to elaborate on a text.They will very soon become completely useless – unless you do somethingwith them. If you already know that you will not go back to them, don’t takethese kind of notes in the first place. Take proper notes instead. Fleeting notes are only useful if you review them within a day or so and turn them intoproper notes you can use later. Fleeting literature notes can make sense if youneed an extra step to understand or grasp an idea, but they will not help youin the later stages of the writing process, as no underlined sentence will everpresent itself when you need it in the development of an argument. Thesekinds of notes are just reminders of a thought, which you haven’t had thetime to elaborate on yet. Permanent notes, on the other hand, are written in away that can still be understood even when you have forgotten the contextthey are taken from.

Most ideas will not stand the test of time, while others might become theseed for a major project. Unfortunately, they are not easy to distinguish rightaway. That is why the threshold to write an idea down has to be as low aspossible, but it is equally crucial to elaborate on them within a day or two. Agood indication that a note has been left unprocessed too long is when you nolonger understand what you meant or it appears banal. In the first case, youforgot what it was supposed to remind you of. In the second case, you forgotthe context that gave it its meaning.

The only permanently stored notes are the literature notes in the referencesystem and the main notes in the slip-box. The former can be very brief as thecontext is clearly the text they refer to. The latter need be written with morecare and details as they need to be self-explanatory. Luhmann neverunderlined sentences in the text he read or wrote comments in the margins.All he did was take brief notes about the ideas that caught his attention in atext on a separate piece of paper: “I make a note with the bibliographicdetails. On the backside I would write ‘on page x is this, on page y is that,’and then it goes into the bibliographic slip-box where I collect everything I read.” (Hagen, 1997)13 But before he stored them away, he would readwhat he noted down during the day, think about its relevance for his ownlines of thought and write about it, filling his main slip-box with permanentnotes. Nothing in this box would ever get thrown away. Some notes mightdisappear into the background and never catch his attention again, whileothers might become connection points to various lines of reasoning andreappear on a regular basis in various contexts.

As it is not possible to foresee the development of the slip-box, the fate ofthe notes is nothing to worry about. In contrast to the fleeting notes, every permanent note for the slip-box is elaborated enough to have the potential tobecome part of or inspire a final written piece, but that can not be decided onup front as their relevance depends on future thinking and developments. Thenotes are no longer reminders of thoughts or ideas, but contain the actualthought or idea in written form. This is a crucial difference.

It is the standardised format that enables the notes to build up a criticalmass in one place. It is also the key to facilitating the thinking and writingprocess by removing all unnecessary complications or decisions that comewith a variety of different formats and storage places. Only because everynote is in the same format at the same place can they later be combined andassembled into something new and no thought is ever wasted on the questionof where to put or label it.

The last type of note, the ones that are related to only one specific project,are kept together with other project-related notes in a project-specific folder.It doesn’t matter in which format these notes are as they are going to end upin the bin after the project is finished anyway (or in an archive – the bin forthe indecisive).

Project-related notes can be:

· comments in the manuscript
· collections of project-related literature
· outlines
· snippets of drafts
· reminders
· to-do lists
· and of course the draft itself.

The Zettelkasten has the built-in function of project-specific desktops.Here, you can not only structure your thoughts and conceptualise the chaptersof your draft, but also collect and sort the notes for this specific projectwithout fear that they will water down or interfere with the slip-box itself.You can even change the notes according to your project without affectingthe notes in the slip-box.

The same applies to the reference system. In Zotero, you can collect literature in project-specific folders without taking them out of the referencesystem itself. All this keeps the permanent notes from the project-relatednotes clearly separated and allows you to experiment and tinker with them asmuch as you like within the boundaries of each project without interferingwith the actual slip-box. I suggest keeping a physical binder for each projectto keep all the handwritten notes and printouts separate from the rest andcombined in one place.

When you close the folder for your current project in the evening andnothing is left on your desk other than pen and paper, you know that youhave achieved a clear separation between fleeting, permanent and project-related notes.

### 7 Nobody Ever Starts From Scratch

“The white sheet of paper – or today: the blank screen – is a fundamental misunderstanding”
(Nassehi 2015, 185)

The process of writing is vastly misunderstood. If you grab off the shelf arandom study guide or self-help book on writing and skim through the firstpages, the chances are that you will encounter something like this: “To makeyour research more efficient, your first step should be to narrow the aspectyou choose to focus on and also formulate an explicit question that your research and analysis will address.”14 Almost always, the decision on thetopic is presented as the necessary first step, after which follows everythingelse, like in this guide: “When you have chosen a topic that is right for you,having taken into consideration your personal interests and any necessarybackground knowledge that may be needed, assess the availability of sources.”15 Thereafter, you will certainly find a multi-step plan you aresupposed to follow: Be it twelve steps, according to the Academic Skills &Learning Centre of the Australian National University, or eight, if you gowith the recommendations of the Writing Center of the University ofWisconsin, the rough order is always the same: Make a decision on what towrite about, plan your research, do your research, write. Interestingly enough,these road maps usually come with the concession that this is only anidealised plan and that in reality, it rarely works like that. This is certainlytrue. Writing can’t be that linear. The obvious question is: If that is true, whynot root the course of action in reality instead?

In order to develop a good question to write about or find the best angle foran assignment, one must already have put some thought into a topic. To beable to decide on a topic, one must already have read quite a bit and certainlynot just about one topic. And the decision to read something and notsomething else is obviously rooted in prior understanding, and that didn’tcome out of thin air, either. Every intellectual endeavour starts from analready existing preconception, which then can be transformed during furtherinquires and can serve as a starting point for following endeavours. Basically,that is what Hans-Georg Gadamer called the hermeneutic circle (Gadamer2004). And even though the hermeneutic circle is regularly taught inuniversity, writing at the same time continues to be taught as if we could start from scratch and move forward in a straight line – as if it were possible topull a good question out of thin air and wait with the reading until theliterature research is done. The seemingly pragmatic and down-to-earth-sounding advice – to decide what to write about before you start writing – istherefore either misleading or banal. It is banal if it means only that youshould think before you put words on paper. It is misleading if it means thatyou could make a sound plan on what to write before you have immersedyourself in the topics at hand, which involves writing. It accompanieseverything: We have to read with a pen in hand, develop ideas on paper andbuild up an ever-growing pool of externalised thoughts. We will not beguided by a blindly made-up plan picked from our unreliable brains, but byour interest, curiosity and intuition, which is formed and informed by theactual work of reading, thinking, discussing, writing and developing ideas –and is something that continuously grows and reflects our knowledge andunderstanding externally.

By focusing on what is interesting and keeping written track of your ownintellectual development, topics, questions and arguments will emerge fromthe material without force. Not only does it means that finding a topic or aresearch question will become easier, as we don’t have to squeeze it out ofthe few ideas that are on top of our head anymore, every question thatemerges out of our slip-box will naturally and handily come with material towork with. If we look into our slip-box to see where clusters have built up,we not only see possible topics, but topics we have already worked on – evenif we were not able to see it up front. The idea that nobody ever starts fromscratch suddenly becomes very concrete. If we take it seriously and workaccordingly, we literally never have to start from scratch again.Of course, those who believe that they do start from scratch don’t reallystart from scratch, either, as they too can only draw on what they havelearned or encountered before. But as they haven’t acted on this fact, theycan’t track ideas back to their origins and have neither supporting material athand nor their sources in order. As writing has not accompanied theirprevious work, they have to either start with something completely new(which is risky) or retrace their ideas (which is boring).

As proper note-taking is rarely taught or discussed, it is no wonder thatalmost every guide on writing recommends to start with brainstorming. Ifyou haven’t written along the way, the brain is indeed the only place to turn to. On its own, it is not such a great choice: it is neither objective nor reliable - \*two quite important aspects in academic or nonfiction writing. Thepromotion of brainstorming as a starting point is all the more surprising as itis not the origin of most ideas: The things you are supposed to find in yourhead by brainstorming usually don’t have their origins in there. Rather, theycome from the outside: through reading, having discussions and listening toothers, through all the things that could have been accompanied and ofteneven would have been improved by writing. The advice to think about whatto write about before you write comes both too early and too late. Too late, asyou already have passed up the chance to build up written resources whenyou face the white sheet of paper or the blank screen, but also too early, ifyou try to postpone every serious content-related work until you have made adecision on the topic.

If something comes too early and too late at the same time, it is notpossible to fix it by rearranging the order as the fictional linearity is theproblem in itself. Taking smart notes is the precondition to break with thelinear order. There is one reliable sign if you managed to structure yourworkflow according to the fact that writing is not a linear process, but acircular one: the problem of finding a topic is replaced by the problem ofhaving too many topics to write about. Having trouble finding the right topicis a symptom of the wrong attempt to rely heavily on the limitations of thebrain, not the inevitable problematic starting point, as most study guidesinsinuate. If you on the other hand develop your thinking in writing, openquestions will become clearly visible and give you an abundance of possibletopics to elaborate further in writing.

After many years of working with students, I am convinced that theattempt of these study guides to squeeze a nonlinear process like writing intoa linear order is the main reason for the very problems and frustrations theypromise to solve. How can you not have trouble finding a topic if you believeyou have to decide on one before you have done your research, have read andlearned about something? How can you not feel threatened by an empty pageif you have literally nothing at hand to fill it with? Who can blame you forprocrastinating if you find yourself stuck with a topic you decided on blindlyand now have to stick with it as the deadline is approaching? And how cananyone be surprised that students feel overwhelmed with writing assignmentswhen they are not taught how to turn months and years of reading, discussing and research into material they can really use?

These study guides, which neglect everything before a writing assignmentis given, are a little bit like financial advisors who discuss how 65-year-oldscan save for retirement. At this point you would be better off curbing yourenthusiasm (which is exactly what one of the most often sold study guides inGermany recommends: first, lower your expectations on quality and insight).16

But those who have already developed their thinking through writing cankeep the focus on what is interesting for them at the moment and accumulatesubstantial material just by doing what they most feel like doing. Thematerial will cluster around the questions they returned to most often, so theydon’t risk too far of a departure from their interest. If your first chosen topicturns out to be not as interesting, you will just move on and your notes willcluster around something else. Maybe you will even note down the reasonswhy the first question is not interesting and turn that into an insight valuableenough to make public. When it finally comes to the decision on what towrite about, you will already have made the decision – because you made iton every single step along the way, again and again every day, improving itgradually. Instead of spending your time worrying about finding the righttopic, you will spend your time actually working on your already existinginterests and doing what is necessary to make informed decisions – reading,thinking and writing. By doing the work, you can trust that interestingquestions will emerge. You might not know where you will end up (and youdon’t need to), but you can’t force insight into a preconceived directionanyway. You minimise both the risk of losing interest in a topic you haveonce chosen ill-informed and the risk of having to start all over again.Even though academic writing is not a linear process, that does not meanyou should follow an anything-goes approach. On the contrary, a clear,reliable structure is paramount.

### 8 Let the Work Carry You Forward

You may remember from school the difference between an exergonic and anendergonic reaction. In the first case, you constantly need to add energy tokeep the process going. In the second case, the reaction, once triggered,continues by itself and even releases energy. The dynamics of work are notso different. Sometimes we feel like our work is draining our energy and wecan only move forward if we put more and more energy into it. Butsometimes it is the opposite. Once we get into the workflow, it is as if thework itself gains momentum, pulling us along and sometimes evenenergizing us. This is the kind of dynamic we are looking for.

A good workflow can easily turn into a virtuous circle, where the positiveexperience motivates us to take on the next task with ease, which helps us toget better at what we are doing, which in return makes it more likely for us toenjoy the work, and so on. But if we feel constantly stuck in our work, wewill become demotivated and much more likely to procrastinate, leaving uswith fewer positive or even bad experiences like missed deadlines. We mightend up in a vicious circle of failure (cf. Fishbach, Eyal and Finkelstein,2010).

Any attempts to trick ourselves into work with external rewards (like doingsomething nice after finishing a chapter) are only short-term solutions withno prospect of establishing a positive feedback loop. These are very fragilemotivational constructions. Only if the work itself becomes rewarding can thedynamic of motivation and reward become self-sustainable and propel thewhole process forward (DePasque and Tricomi, 2015).

The extraordinary successful fitness motivation coach Michelle Segar usesthis dynamic to turn even the most stubborn coach potatoes into exerciseaficionados (Segar, 2015). She brings those who really don’t like exercise butknow they have to do it into a sustainable workout routine by focusing on onething: Creating satisfying, repeatable experiences with sports. It doesn’tmatter what her clients are doing – running, walking, team sports, gymworkouts or bicycling to work. The only thing that matters is that theydiscover something that gives them a good experience that they would like tohave again. Once her clients find something, they are encouraged enough to try something else as well. They enter the virtuous circle where willpowerisn’t needed anymore because they feel like doing it anyway. If they tried totrick themselves into exercise by rewarding themselves afterwards with arelaxed evening on the sofa watching TV, it wouldn’t have taken them longuntil they went straight for the sofa, skipping the workout altogether, becausethis is how we tick.

Feedback loops are not only crucial for the dynamics of motivation, butalso the key element to any learning process. Nothing motivates us more thanthe experience of becoming better at what we do. And the only chance toimprove in something is getting timely and concrete feedback. Seekingfeedback, not avoiding it, is the first virtue of anyone who wants to learn, orin the more general terms of psychologist Carol Dweck, to grow. Dweckshows convincingly that the most reliable predictor for long-term success ishaving a “growth mindset.” To actively seek and welcome feedback, be itpositive or negative, is one of the most important factors for success (andhappiness) in the long run. Conversely, nothing is a bigger hindrance topersonal growth than having a “fixed mindset.” Those who fear and avoidfeedback because it might damage their cherished positive self-image mightfeel better in the short term, but will quickly fall behind in actual performance(Dweck 2006; 2013). Ironically, it is therefore often the highly gifted andtalented students, who receive a lot of praise, who are more in danger ofdeveloping a fixed mindset and getting stuck. Having been praised for whatthey are (talented and gifted) rather than for what they do, they tend to focuson keeping this impression intact, rather than exposing themselves to newchallenges and the possibility of learning from failure. Embracing a growthmindset means to get pleasure out of changing for the better (which is mostlyinwardly rewarding) instead of getting pleasure in being praised (which isoutwardly rewarding). The orientation towards the latter makes one stick tosafe, proven areas. The orientation towards the first draws the attention to theareas most in need of improvement. To seek as many opportunities to learn aspossible is the most reliable long-term growth strategy. And if growth andsuccess are not reasons enough, then maybe the fact that the fear of failurehas the ugliest name of all phobias: Kakorrhaphiophobia.

Having a growth mindset is crucial, but only one side of the equation.Having a learning system in place that enables feedback loops in a practicalway is equally important. Being open for feedback doesn’t help very much if the only feedback you can get comes once every few months for work youhave already finished. The linear model of academic writing comes with veryfew feedback opportunities, and even those are usually spread out over time(vgl. Fritzsche, Young und Hickson, 2003). If you choose a topic for yourpaper and work according to the linear model, you will only learn if yourchoice was wise after multiple stages of research. The same applies to thequestion of if you understood what you read and if your idea for an argumentmakes sense.

Following a circular approach, on the other hand, allows you to implementmany feedback loops, which give you the chance to improve your work whileyou are working on it. It is not just about increasing the number ofopportunities to learn, but also to be able to correct the mistakes weinevitably make. As the feedback loops are usually smaller than one bigchunk of feedback at the end, they are also much less scary and easier toembrace.

Reading with a pen in the hand, for example, forces, us to think about whatwe read and check upon our understanding. It is the simplest test: We tend tothink we understand what we read – until we try to rewrite it in our ownwords. By doing this, we not only get a better sense of our ability tounderstand, but also increase our ability to clearly and concisely express ourunderstanding – which in return helps to grasp ideas more quickly. If we tryto fool ourselves here and write down incomprehensible words, we willdetect it in the next step when we try to turn our literature notes intopermanent notes and try to connect them with others.

The ability to express understanding in one’s own words is a fundamentalcompetency for everyone who writes – and only by doing it with the chanceof realizing our lack of understanding can we become better at it. But thebetter we become, the easier and quicker we can make notes, which againincreases the number of learning experiences. The same applies to the crucialability to distinguish the important bits of a text from the less important ones:the better we become at it, the more effective our reading will become, themore we can read, the more we will learn. We will enter a beautiful, virtuouscircle of competency. You cannot help but feel motivated by it.The same goes for writing permanent notes, which have another feedbackloop built-in: Expressing our own thoughts in writing makes us realise if wereally thought them through. The moment we try to combine them with previously written notes, the system will unambiguously show uscontradictions, inconsistencies and repetitions. While these built-in feedbackloops do not make redundant the feedback from your peers or supervisor,they are the only ones that are always available and can help us to improve alittle bit, multiple times every single day. And the best thing about this is thatwhile we learn and become better, our slip-box becomes more knowledgeabletoo. It grows and improves. And the more it grows, the more useful itbecomes and the easier it will be for us to make new connections.

The slip-box is not a collection of notes. Working with it is less aboutretrieving specific notes and more about being pointed to relevant facts andgenerating insight by letting ideas mingle. Its usability grows with its size,not just linearly but exponentially. When we turn to the slip-box, its innerconnectedness will not just provide us with isolated facts, but with lines ofdeveloped thoughts. Moreover, because of its inner complexity, a searchthought the slip-box will confront us with related notes we did not look for.This is a very significant difference that becomes more and more relevantover time. The more content it contains, the more connections it can provide,and the easier it becomes to add new entries in a smart way and receiveuseful suggestions.

Our brains work not that differently in terms of interconnectedness.Psychologists used to think of the brain as a limited storage space that slowlyfills up and makes it more difficult to learn late in life. But we know todaythat the more connected information we already have, the easier it is to learn,because new information can dock to that information. Yes, our ability tolearn isolated facts is indeed limited and probably decreases with age. But iffacts are not kept isolated nor learned in an isolated fashion, but hangtogether in a network of ideas, or “latticework of mental models” (Munger,1994), it becomes easier to make sense of new information. That makes iteasier not only to learn and remember, but also to retrieve the informationlater in the moment and context it is needed.

As we are the authors of all the notes, we learn in lockstep with the slip-box. This is another big difference from using an encyclopaedia likeWikipedia. We use the same mental models, theories and terms to organiseour thoughts in our brains as in our slip-box. That the slip-box generates anexcess of possibilities enables it to surprise and inspire us to generate newideas and develop our theories further. It is not the slip-box or our brains alone, but the dynamic between them that makes working with it soproductive.

## THE SIX STEPS TO SUCCESSFUL WRITING

### 9 Separate and Interlocking Tasks

#### _9.1 Give Each Task Your Undivided Attention_

According to a widely cited study, the constant interruption of emails and textmessages cuts our productivity by about 40% and makes us at least 10 IQpoints dumber. Even though this study was never published, makes no claimsabout intelligence and is statistically irrelevant, it does seem to confirm whatmost of us believe anyway and that is that we might have an attention deficitproblem. It might not show it by content, but the mere fact that it waspossible to have a misunderstanding spreading so fast under titles like “E-mails ‘hurt IQ more than pot’ ” (CNN) is telling. There are real studies aboutthat as well. We know for example that watching television reduces theattention span of children (Swing et al. 2010). We also know that the averagelength of TV soundbites has steadily declined over the last several decades(Fehrmann, 2011). During the U.S. presidential election in 1968, the averagesoundbite — that is, any footage of a candidate speaking uninterrupted —was still a little more than 40 seconds, but that had fallen to less than 10seconds at the end of the 80s (Hallin 1994) and 7.8 seconds in 2000 (Lichter,2001). The last election has certainly not reversed the trend. Whether thatmeans that the media adjust to our decreasing attention span or is causing the trend is not easy to say.17 But however it might be, it is obvious that we aresurrounded by more sources of distraction and less opportunities to train ourattention spans.

#### _9.2 Multitasking is not a good idea_

If more than one thing tries to catch your attention, the temptation is great tolook at more than one thing at the same time – to multitask. Many peopleclaim to be quite good at multitasking. For some, it is one of the mostimportant skills to cope with today’s informational overload. It is a commonbelief that the younger generations are better at it, that it even comes naturallyto them as they grew up among the attention-seeking new media. And studiesshow that those who claim to multitask a lot also claim to be very good at it.Those interviewed in these studies do not see their productivity impaired byit. On the contrary, they think it’s improved. But they usually don’t test themselves in comparison with a control group.

Psychologists who interviewed the multitaskers did test them instead ofjust asking. They gave them different tasks to accomplish and compared theirresults with another group that was instructed to do only one thing at a time.The outcome is unambiguous: While those who multitasked felt moreproductive, their productivity actually decreased – a lot (Wang and Tchernev2012; Rosen 2008; Ophir, Nass, and Wagner 2009). Not only the quantity butalso the quality of their accomplishments lagged significantly behind that ofthe control group.

In some areas, like texting and driving, the downsides of multitasking arepainfully obvious. But what is most interesting about these studies is not thefact that the productivity and the quality of the work decreases withmultitasking, but that it also impairs the ability to deal with more than onething at a time!

This result is surprising, because we usually expect to become better atsomething the more often we do it. But on a closer look, it makes sense.Multitasking is not what we think it is. It is not focusing attention on morethan one thing at a time. Nobody can do that. When we think we multitask,what we really do is shift our attention quickly between two (or more) things.And every shift is a drain on our ability to shift and delays the moment wemanage to get focused again. Trying to multitask fatigues us and decreasesour ability to deal with more than one task.

The fact that people nevertheless believe that they can get better at it andincrease their productivity can easily be explained by two factors. The first isthe lack of a control group or an objective external measurement that wouldprovide us with the feedback we need to learn. The second is whatpsychologists call the mere-exposure effect: doing something many timesmakes us believe we have become good at it – completely independent of ouractual performance (Bornstein 1989). We unfortunately tend to confusefamiliarity with skill.

If the only reason to mention this is to recommend you not write yourthesis or books while driving, it would be quite banal (still a good idea,though). But it does have practical consequences for the way we work if wethink about what “writing” truly means: many different tasks we might endup trying to do at the same time if we don’t separate them consciously andpractically.

Writing a paper involves much more than just typing on the keyboard. Italso means reading, understanding, reflecting, getting ideas, makingconnections, distinguishing terms, finding the right words, structuring,organizing, editing, correcting and rewriting. All these are not just differenttasks, but tasks requiring a different kind of attention. It is not onlyimpossible to focus on more than one thing at a time, but also to have adifferent kind of attention on more than one thing at a time.

Usually, when we think about attention, we only think about focusedattention – something that requires willpower to sustain. This is not toosurprising, because this is what most psychologists, philosophers andneuroscientists used to have in mind when they talked about attention (Bruya2010, 5). Today, research differentiates between multiple forms of attention.Ever since Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi in the 1970s described “flow,” the statein which being highly focused becomes effortless (Csikszentmihalyi, 1975),18 other forms of attention, which are much less dependent on will and effort, attracted researchers’ interest.

When it comes to focused attention, we focus on one thing only, somethingwe can sustain for only a few seconds. The maximum duration of focusedattention seems not to have changed over time (Doyle and Zakrajsek 2013,91). Focused attention is different from “sustained attention,” which we needto stay focused on one task for a longer period and is necessary to learn,understand or get something done. This is the kind of attention that is mostcertainly under threat from an increase in distractions. The average durationseems to have shrunken quite considerably over time – we practice much lessfocused attention than we used to (ibid).

The good news is that we can train ourselves to stay focused on one thingfor longer if we avoid multitasking, remove possible distractions and separatedifferent kinds of tasks as much as possible so they will not interfere witheach other. This too is not just a question of having the right mindset, but,equally important, of how we organise our workflow. A lack of structuremakes it much more challenging to stay focused for extended periods of time.The slip-box provides not only a clear structure to work in, but also forces usto shift our attention consciously as we can complete tasks in reasonable timebefore moving on to the next one. Together with the fact that every task isaccompanied by writing, which in itself requires undistracted attention, the slip-box can become a haven for our restless minds.

#### _9.3 Give Each Task the Right Kind of Attention_

On closer look, it becomes obvious how different the tasks are that areusually summarised under “writing” and how different the kinds of attentionare that they require.

Proofreading, for example, is obviously part of the writing process, butrequires a very different state of mind than the attempt to find the rightwords. When we proofread a manuscript, we take on the role of a critic whotakes a step back to see the text with the eyes of a dispassionate reader. Wescan the text for typos, try to smooth out patches and check structure. Wedeliberately put distance between ourselves and the text to see what is reallyon the paper, not just in our heads. We try to block out the knowledge ofwhat we meant to say to be able to see what we wrote.

While taking on the role of a critic is not the same as being an impartialreader, it is enough to spot most of what we missed before: the holes in theargument, the parts we did not explain as we did not need to explain them toourselves. To be able to switch between the role of critic and the role ofwriter requires a clear separation between these two tasks, and that becomeseasier with experience. If we proofread a manuscript and don’t manage to getenough distance from ourselves as authors, we will only see our thoughts, notthe actual text. It is a common issue that comes up during discussions withstudents: When I point out problems within the argument, an ill-defined termor just an ambiguous passage, students usually refer to what they mean firstand only shift their focus to what they have written when they fullyunderstand that what they mean is completely irrelevant within the scientificcommunity.

Letting the inner critic interfere with the author isn’t helpful, either. Herewe have to focus our attention on our thoughts. If the critic constantly andprematurely interferes whenever a sentence isn’t perfect yet, we would neverget anything on paper. We need to get our thoughts on paper first andimprove them there , where we can look at them. Especially complex ideasare difficult to turn into a linear text in the head alone. If we try to please thecritical reader instantly, our workflow would come to a standstill. We tend tocall extremely slow writers, who always try to write as if for print,perfectionists. Even though it sounds like praise for extreme professionalism, it is not: A real professional would wait until it was time for proofreading, sohe or she can focus on one thing at a time. While proofreading requires morefocused attention, finding the right words during writing requires much morefloating attention.

It is also easier to focus on finding the right words if we don’t have to thinkabout the structure of the text at the same time, which is why a printed outlineof the manuscript should be always in front of our eyes. We have to knowwhat we don’t have to write about at the moment, because we know that wewill take care of that in another part of our text.

Outlining or changing the outline is also a very different task that requiresa very different focus on something else: not on one thought, but on thewhole argument. It is important, though, to understand outlining not as thepreparation of writing or even as planning, but as a separate task we need toreturn to throughout the writing process on a regular basis. We need astructure all the time, but as we work our way bottom-up, it is bound tochange often. And whenever we need to update the structure, we need to takea step back, look at the big picture and change it accordingly.

Proofreading, formulating and outlining are also different from the task ofcombining and developing thoughts. Working with the slip-box meansplaying with ideas and looking out for interesting connections andcomparisons. It means building clusters, combining them with other clustersand preparing the order of notes for a project. Here, we need to puzzle withnotes and find the best fit. It is much more associative, playful and creativethan the other tasks and requires a very different kind of attention as well.Reading, of course, is also different. Reading in itself can require verydifferent kinds of attention, depending on the text. Some texts need to be readslowly and carefully, while others are only worth skimming. It would beridiculous to adhere to a general formula and read every text in the same way,even though that is what many study guides or speed-reading courses try toconvince us of. It is not a sign of professionalism to master one technique andstick to it no matter what, but to be flexible and adjust one’s reading towhatever speed or approach a text requires.

In short, academic writing requires the whole spectrum of attention. Tomaster the art of writing, we need to be able to apply whatever kind ofattention and focus is needed.

Psychologists used to associate scientific work exclusively with focussed attention, while other, more floating kinds of attention were exclusivelyassociated with creative work like art. We know today that we need bothkinds of attention for art and science. It is not surprising, therefore, that thisflexibility can be found among most, if not all, exceptional scientists. OshinVartanian compared and analysed the daily workflows of Nobel Prizewinners and other eminent scientists and concluded that it is not a relentlessfocus, but flexible focus that distinguishes them. “Specifically, the problem-solving behavior of eminent scientists can alternate between extraordinarylevels of focus on specific concepts and playful exploration of ideas. Thissuggests that successful problem solving may be a function of flexiblestrategy application in relation to task demands.” (Vartanian 2009, 57)These studies help to solve a puzzle that has bothered psychologists whostudy creative people as well. “On one hand, those with wandering,defocused, childlike minds seem to be the most creative; on the other, itseems to be analysis and application that’s important. The answer to thisconundrum is that creative people need both ... The key to creativity is beingable to switch between a wide-open, playful mind and a narrow analyticalframe.” (Dean, 2013, 152)What psychologists do not discuss, though, are the external conditions thatallow us to be flexible in the first place. The mental flexibility to beextremely focused for one moment and playfully explore ideas in the next isjust one side of the equation. To be flexible, we need an equally flexible workstructure that doesn’t break down every time we depart from a preconceivedplan. One can be the best driver with the quickest reactions, able to adjustflexibly to different street and weather conditions. None of that will help a bitif the driver is stuck on rails. And it does not help us to have great insight intothe necessity of being flexible in our work if we are stuck in a rigidorganisation.

Unfortunately, the most common way people organise their writing is bymaking plans. Although planning is almost universally recommended bystudy guides, it’s the equivalent of putting oneself on rails.Don’t make plans. Become an expert.

#### _9.4 Become an Expert Instead of a Planner_

“(An) exclusive use of analytical rationality tends to impede further improvement in human
performance because of analytical rationality’s slow reasoning and its emphasis on rules, principles, and universal solutions. Second, bodily involvement, speed, and an intimate
knowledge of concrete cases in the form of good examples is a prerequisite for true expertise.”
(Flyvbjerg 2001, 15)

The moment we stop making plans is the moment we start to learn. It is amatter of practice to become good at generating insight and write good textsby choosing and moving flexibly between the most important and promisingtasks, judged by nothing else than the circumstances of the given situation. Itis similar to the moment where we had the training wheels of our bikes takenoff and started to learn cycling properly. We might have felt a bit insecure inthe first moment, but at the same time, it became obvious that we wouldnever have learned to bicycle if we left the training wheels on. The only thingwe would have learned is to ride a bike with training wheels on.Similarly, no one would ever learn the art of productive academic writingjust by following plans or linear, multistep prescripts – one would learn onlyto follow plans or prescripts. The widespread praise for planning rests on themisconception that a process like writing an academic text, which is highlydependent on cognition and thinking, can rely on conscious decision-makingalone. But academic writing is an art, as well, which means it is somethingwe can become better at with experience and deliberate practice.Experts rely on embodied experience, which enables them to reach thestate of virtuosity. An expert in academic writing has a feel for the process,an acquired intuition for which task will bring one closer to the finishedmanuscript and what is only a distraction. There can be no universallyapplicable rule about which step has to be taken when. Each new project isdifferent, and at each stage of the project, it might be best to read up onsomething, to review a passage, to discuss an idea or to change the outline ofthe manuscript. There is no universal rule that could tell one upfront at whichstage it wouldn’t make sense to follow up on an idea, a possible contradictionor a footnote.

To be able to become an expert, we need the freedom to make our owndecisions and all the necessary mistakes that help us learn. Like bicycling, itcan only be learned by doing it. Most study guides and academic writingteachers are trying very hard to spare you from that experience by telling youwhat, when and how to write instead. But they are keeping you from learningthe very thing academia and writing is all about: gaining insight and makingit public.

And this, by the way, is the reason why you should never ask the teachersof paramedics for help if you find yourself in the admittedly unlikelysituation where you can choose the person who should perform CPR on you.In an experiment, beginner and expert paramedics and their teachers wereshown scenes of CPR performed by either experienced paramedics or those who had just finished their training (Flyvbjerg 2001).19

As you might expect, the experienced paramedics were able to spot theirkind correctly in almost all cases (~90%), while the beginners were more orless just guessing (~50%). So far, so good. But when the teachers watched thevideos, they systematically mistook the beginners for experts and the expertsfor beginners. They were wrong in most of the cases (and only right in abouta third of all the cases).

Hubert and Stuart Dreyfus, researchers on expertise, have a simpleexplanation: Teachers tend to mistake the ability to follow (their) rules withthe ability to make the right choices in real situations. Unlike the expertparamedics, they did not look at the unique circumstances and check if theparamedics in the videos did the best thing possible in each individualsituation. Instead, they focused on the question of whether the people in thevideos acted according to the rules they taught.

Because trainees lack the experience to judge a situation correctly andconfidently, they need to stick to the rules they were taught, much to thedelight of their teachers. According to the Dreyfuses, the correct applicationof teachable rules enables you to become a competent “performer” (whichcorresponds to a “3” on their five-grade expert scale), but it won’t make youa “master” (level 4) and certainly won’t turn you into an “expert” (level 5).Experts, on the other hand, have internalised the necessary knowledge sothey don’t have to actively remember rules or think consciously about theirchoices. They have acquired enough experience in various situations to beable to rely on their intuition to know what to do in which kind of situation.Their decisions in complex situations are explicitly not made by longrational-analytical considerations, but rather come from the gut (cf.Gigerenzer, 2008a, 2008b).

Here, gut feeling is not a mysterious force, but an incorporated history ofexperience. It is the sedimentation of deeply learned practice through numerous feedback loops on success or failure.20 Even a rational and analytical endeavour like science does not function without expertise,intuition and experience – which is one of the most interesting outcomes ofthe empirical research on natural scientists in their laboratories (Rheinberger1997). Chess players seem to think less than beginners. Rather, they seepatterns and let themselves be guided by their experience from the past ratherthan attempt to calculate turns far into the future.

But like in professional chess, the intuition of professional academic andnonfiction writing can also only be gained by systematic exposure tofeedback loops and experience, which means that success in academicwriting depends to a great degree on the organization of its practical side.The workflow around the slip-box is not a prescription that tells you what todo at what stage of writing. On the contrary: It gives you a structure ofclearly separable tasks, which can be completed within reasonable time andprovides you with instant feedback through interconnected writing tasks. Itallows you to become better by giving you the opportunity for deliberatepractice. The more experience you gain, the more you will be able to rely onyour intuition to tell you what to do next. Instead of taking you “fromintuition to professional writing strategies”, as the title of a typical studyguide promises, it is here all about becoming a professional by acquiring theskills and experience to judge situations correctly and intuitively so you canchuck misleading study guides for good. Real experts, Flyvbjerg writesunambiguously, don’t make plans (Flyvbjerg 2001, 19).

#### _9.5 Get Closure_

Attention is not our only limited resource. Our short-term memory is alsolimited. We need strategies not to waste its capacity with thoughts we canbetter delegate to an external system. While the estimations of our long-termmemory capacity are wildly diverse and rather speculative, psychologistsused to tend to agree on a very specific number when it came to short-termmemory: We can hold a maximum of seven things in our head at the sametime, plus/minus two (Miller 1956).

Information cannot be saved in short-term memory like on a memory stick.Rather, it kind of floats around in our heads, seeks our attention and occupiesvaluable mental resources until it is either forgotten, replaced by something more important (according to our brains) or moved into long-term memory.

When we try to remember something, say items on a shopping list, we justkeep repeating the items mentally, instead of storing them temporarily insome corner of our brains where we can pick them up later and think aboutsomething more interesting in the meantime.

But what about memory artists? It might seem like we can increase thenumber of things we can remember by employing memo techniques – andnot just a bit, but significantly. But what we actually do when we use memotechniques is to bundle items together in a meaningful way and remember thebundles – up to about seven (Levin and Levin, 1990). Or, if recent research isright and the participants in earlier tests have always already bundled thingstogether, then the maximum capacity of our working memory is not sevenplus/minus two, but more like a maximum of four (Cowan 2001).

Have a look at the following number sequence only once and try toremember it right away: 11 95 82 19 62 31 96 64 19 70 51 97 4.

That’s difficult, as it has clearly more than seven digits. But it is quite easywhen you realise that these are just five years of the World Cup numberedconsecutively. Therefore, you have to remember much less than sevenindividual items. You only have to remember two – the rule and the starting year.21

This is why it is so much easier to remember things we understand thanthings we don’t. It is not that we have to choose to focus either on learning orunderstanding. It is always about understanding – and if it is only for the sakeof learning. Things we understand are connected, either through rules,theories, narratives, pure logic, mental models or explanations. Anddeliberately building these kinds of meaningful connections is what the slip-box is all about.

Every step is accompanied by questions like: How does this fact fit into myidea of ...? How can this phenomenon be explained by that theory? Are thesetwo ideas contradictory or do they complement each other? Isn’t thisargument similar to that one? Haven’t I heard this before? And above all:What does x mean for y? These questions not only increase ourunderstanding, but facilitate learning as well. Once we make a meaningfulconnection to an idea or fact, it is difficult not to remember it when we thinkabout what it is connected with.

While we want to remember some things as long as possible, we don’twant to clog our brains with irrelevant information. And the way we organiseeveryday information makes a big difference not only for long-termmemories, but short-term as well.

Here, we have to thank Soviet psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik for herinsight and observational skills. The story goes that she went for lunch withher colleagues and was very impressed by the waiter’s ability to remembercorrectly who ordered what without the need to write anything down. It issaid that she had to go back to the restaurant to get the jacket she left there.Much to her surprise, the waiter she admired just minutes ago for his greatmemory didn’t even recognise her. Questioned about what seemed to her acontradiction, he explained that all the waiters had no problem rememberingthe orders and matching them with the guests at the table. But the verysecond diners left the restaurant, the waiters all forgot them completely andfocused on the next group.

Zeigarnik successfully reproduced what is now known as the Zeigarnikeffect: Open tasks tend to occupy our short-term memory – until they aredone. That is why we get so easily distracted by thoughts of unfinished tasks,regardless of their importance. But thanks to Zeigarnik’s follow-up research,we also know that we don’t actually have to finish tasks to convince ourbrains to stop thinking about them. All we have to do is to write them downin a way that convinces us that it will be taken care of. That’s right: The braindoesn't distinguish between an actual finished task and one that is postponedby taking a note. By writing something down, we literally get it out of ourheads. This is why David Allen’s “Getting things done” system works: Thesecret to have a “mind like water” is to get all the little stuff out of our short-term memory. And as we can’t take care of everything once and for all rightnow, the only way to do that is to have a reliable external system in placewhere we can keep all our nagging thoughts about the many things that needto be done and trust that they will not be lost. ^ch9-sec5-par10

And the same is true for the work with the slip-box. To be able to focus onthe task at hand, we have to make sure other, unfinished tasks are notlingering in our head and wasting precious mental resources.The first step is to break down the amorphous task of “writing” intosmaller pieces of different tasks that can be finished in one go. The secondstep is to make sure we always write down the outcome of our thinking, including possible connections to further inquiries. As the outcome of eachtask is written down and possible connections become visible, it is easy topick up the work any time where we left it without having to keep it in mind all the time. 22 Possible subsequent tasks are open questions or connectionsto other notes, which we could elaborate on further or not. It also comes up inexplicit reminders like “review this chapter and check for redundancies,”which belong into the project folder. Or the third option is the simple fact thatsomething is still in our in-box waiting to be turned into a permanent note – aquick and not-yet–crossed-out note in our notebook, or literature notes notyet archived in our reference system.

All this enables us to later pick up a task exactly where we stopped withoutthe need to “keep in mind” that there still was something to do. That is one ofthe main advantages of thinking in writing – everything is externalisedanyway.

Conversely, we can use the Zeigarnik effect to our advantage bydeliberately keeping unanswered questions in our mind. We can ruminateabout them, even when we do something that has nothing to do with workand ideally does not require our full attention. Letting thoughts linger withoutfocusing on them gives our brains the opportunity to deal with problems in adifferent, often surprisingly productive way. While we have a walk or ashower or clean the house, the brain cannot help but play around with the lastunsolved problem it came across. And that is why we so often find theanswer to a question in rather casual situations.

By taking into account these little insights into how our brains work, wecan make sure that we will not get distracted by thoughts of what we needfrom the supermarket when we sit at the desk. Rather, we may solve a crucialproblem while we run errands.

#### _9.6 Reduce the Number of Decisions_

Next to the attention that can only be directed at one thing at a time and theshort-term memory that can only hold up to seven things at once, the thirdlimited resource is motivation or willpower. Here, too, the environmentaldesign of our workflow makes all the difference. It shouldn’t come as asurprise anymore that a close cooperation with the slip-box turns out to be farsuperior to any sophisticated planning.

For the longest time, willpower was seen more as a character trait than aresource. This has changed. Today, willpower is compared to muscles: alimited resource that depletes quickly and needs time to recover.Improvement through training is possible to a certain degree, but takes timeand effort. The phenomenon is usually discussed under the term “egodepletion”: “We use the term ego depletion to refer to a temporary reductionin the self’s capacity or willingness to engage in volitional action (includingcontrolling the environment, controlling the self, making choices, andinitiating action) caused by prior exercise of volition.” (Baumeister et al.,1998, 1253)

One of the most interesting findings of the research on ego depletion is thebroad variety of things that can have a depleting effect.

“Our results suggest that a broad assortment of actions make use of the same resource. Acts
of self-control, responsible decision making, and active choice seem to interfere with other
such acts that follow soon after. The implication is that some vital resource of the self
becomes depleted by such acts of volition. To be sure, we assume that this resource is
commonly replenished, although the factors that might hasten or delay the replenishment
remain unknown, along with the precise nature of this resource.” (Baumeister et al., 1998,
1263f)

Even something seemingly unrelated like being the victim of prejudices canhave a significant effect (Inzlicht, McKay, and Aronson, 2006) as“controlling the influence of stereotypes (... may rely on the same...)limited-strength resource on which people draw for self-regulation”(Govorun and Payne 2006, 112).

The smartest way to deal with this kind of limitation is to cheat. Instead offorcing ourselves to do something we don’t feel like doing, we need to find away to make us feel like doing what moves our project further along. Doingthe work that need to be done without having to apply too much willpowerrequires a technique, a ruse.

Even though results of these studies are currently under intense scrutinyand have to be taken with a grain of salt (Carter and McCullough 2014;Engber and Cauterucci 2016; Job, Dweck and Walton 2010), it is safe toargue that a reliable and standardised working environment is less taxing onour attention, concentration and willpower, or, if you like, ego. It is wellknown that decision-making is one of the most tiring and wearying tasks,which is why people like Barack Obama or Bill Gates only wear two suit colours: dark blue or dark grey. This means they have one less decision tomake in the morning, leaving more resources for the decisions that reallymatter.

In the way we organise our research and writing, we too can significantlyreduce the amount of decisions we have to make. While content-relateddecisions have to be made (on what is more and what is less important in anarticle, on the connections between notes, the structure of a text, etc.), mostorganisational decisions can be made up front, once and for all, by decidingon one system. By always using the same notebook for making quick notes,always extracting the main ideas from a text in the same way and alwaysturning them into the same kind of permanent notes, which are always dealtwith in the same manner, the number of decisions during a work session canbe greatly reduced. That leaves us with much more mental energy that we candirect towards more useful tasks, like trying to solve the problems inquestion.

Being able to finish a task in a timely manner and to pick up the workexactly where we left it has another enjoyable advantage that helps to restoreour attention: We can have breaks without fear of losing the thread. Breaksare much more than just opportunities to recover. They are crucial forlearning. They allow the brain to process information, move it into long-termmemory and prepare it for new information (Doyle and Zakrajsek 2013, 69).23 If we don’t give ourselves a break in between work sessions, be it out of eagerness or fear of forgetting what we were doing, it can have a detrimental effect on our efforts. To have a walk (Ratey, 2008) or even a nap24 supports learning and thinking.25

### 10 Read for Understanding

“I would advise you to read with a pen in your hand and enter in a little book short hints of
what you feel that is common or that may be useful; for this will be the best method of
imprinting such portcullis in your memory.”

- \*Benjamin Franklin26

#### _10.1 Read With a Pen in Hand_

To get a good paper written, you only have to rewrite a good draft; to get agood draft written, you only have to turn a series of notes into a continuoustext. And as a series of notes is just the rearrangement of notes you alreadyhave in your slip-box, all you really have to do is have a pen in your handwhen you read.

If you understand what you read and translate it into the different contextof your own thinking, materialised in the slip-box, you cannot help buttransform the findings and thoughts of others into something that is new andyour own. It works both ways: The series of notes in the slip-box developsinto arguments, which are shaped by the theories, ideas and mental modelsyou have in your head. And the theories, ideas and mental models in yourhead are also shaped by the things you read. They are constantly changingand challenged by the surprising connections with which the slip-boxconfronts you. The richer the slip-box becomes, the richer your own thinkingbecomes. The slip-box is an idea generator that develops in lockstep withyour own intellectual development. Together, you can turn previouslyseparated or even isolated facts into a critical mass of interconnected ideas.The step from the slip-box to the final text is pretty straightforward. Thecontent is already meaningful, thought through and in many parts already putinto well-connected sequences. The notes only need to be put into a linearorder. While the notes themselves are formulated so that they can beunderstood on their own, they are at the same time embedded in one or morecontexts that enrich their meaning. Drawing from the slip-box to develop adraft is more like a dialogue with it than a mechanical act. Therefore, theoutcome is never a copy of previous work, but always comes with surprises.There will always be something you couldn’t have anticipated. Obviously,the same applies to every single step before. The outcome of reading with a pen in the hand is not possible to anticipate either, and here, too, the idea isnot to copy, but to have a meaningful dialogue with the texts we read.When we extract ideas from the specific context of a text, we deal withideas that serve a specific purpose in a particular context, support a specificargument, are part of a theory that isn’t ours or written in a language wewouldn’t use. This is why we have to translate them into our own language toprepare them to be embedded into new contexts of our own thinking, thedifferent context(s) within the slip-box. Translating means to give the truestpossible account of the original work, using different words – it does notmean the freedom to make something fit. As well, the mere copying of quotesalmost always changes their meaning by stripping them out of context, eventhough the words aren’t changed. This is a common beginner mistake, whichcan only lead to a patchwork of ideas, but never a coherent thought.

While the literature notes will be stored within the reference systemtogether with the bibliographic details, separate from the slip-box, but stillclose to the context of the original text, they are already written with an eyetowards the lines of thoughts within the slip-box. Luhmann describes thisstep as follows: “I always have a slip of paper at hand, on which I note downthe ideas of certain pages. On the backside I write down the bibliographicdetails. After finishing the book I go through my notes and think how thesenotes might be relevant for already written notes in the slip-box. It means thatI always read with an eye towards possible connections in the slip-box.”(Luhmann et al., 1987, 150)

How extensive the literature notes should be really depends on the text andwhat we need it for. It also depends on our ability to be concise, thecomplexity of the text and how difficult it is to understand. As literature notesare also a tool for understanding and grasping the text, more elaborate notesmake sense in more challenging cases, while in easier cases it might besufficient to just jot down some keywords. Luhmann, certainly being on theouter spectrum of expertise, contented himself with pretty short notes andwas still able to turn them into valuable slip-box notes without distorting the meaning of the original texts.27 It is mainly a matter of having an extensivelatticework of mental models or theories in our heads that enable us toidentify and describe the main ideas quickly (cf. Rickheit and Sichelschmidt,1999). Whenever we explore a new, unfamiliar subject, our notes will tend to be more extensive, but we shouldn’t get nervous about it, as this is thedeliberate practice of understanding we cannot skip. Sometimes it isnecessary to slowly work our way through a difficult text and sometimes it isenough to reduce a whole book to a single sentence. The only thing thatmatters is that these notes provide the best possible support for the next step,the writing of the actual slip-box notes. And what is most helpful is to reflecton the frame, the theoretical background, methodological approach orperspective of the text we read. That often means to reflect as much on whatis not mentioned as what is mentioned.

Taking literature notes this way is very different from the way literaturenotes are taken by most students, which is either not systematic enough oroverly systematic. Most often, it is just systematic in the wrong way: Byemploying often-recommended reading techniques like SQ3R or SQ4R, theytreat every text the same, regardless of the content. They do not clearlydecide on the format and the organisation of their notes and do not have aplan for what to do with them afterwards. Without a clear purpose for thenotes, taking them will feel more like a chore than an important step within abigger project. Sometimes, long excerpts are written with good intentions, butthat is not sustainable. Sometimes the only thing that is done is underliningsentences and making some comments in the margins of a book, which isalmost like taking no notes at all. And more often than not, reading is notaccompanied by taking notes, which is, in terms of writing, almost asvaluable as not having read at all. Here, everything is about building up acritical mass of useful notes in the slip-box, which gives us a clear idea ofhow to read and how to take literature notes.

While the purpose of taking literature notes is as clear as the procedure,you are free to use whatever technique helps the most with understandingwhat you are reading and getting to useful notes – even if you use tendifferent colours for underlining and a SQ8R reading technique. But all ofthis would be just an extra step before you do the only step that really counts,which is to take the permanent note that will add value to the actual slip-box.You need to take some form of literature note that captures yourunderstanding of the text, so you have something in front of your eyes whileyou are making the slip-box note. But don’t turn it into a project in itself.Literature notes are short and meant to help with writing slip-box notes.Everything else either helps to get to this point or is a distraction.

You can type a literature note directly into Zotero, where it will be storedwith the bibliographic details. You might want to write them by hand,though. Different independent studies indicate that writing by hand facilitatesunderstanding. In a small but fascinating study, two psychologists tried tofind out if it made a difference if students in a lecture took notes by hand orby typing them into their laptops (Mueller and Oppenheimer 2014). Theywere not able to find any difference in terms of the number of facts thestudents were able to remember. But in terms of understanding the content ofthe lecture, the students who took their notes by hand came out much, muchbetter. After a week, this difference in understanding was still clearlymeasurable.

There is no secret to it and the explanation is pretty simple: Handwriting isslower and can’t be corrected as quickly as electronic notes. Because studentscan’t write fast enough to keep up with everything that is said in a lecture,they are forced to focus on the gist of what is being said, not the details. Butto be able to note down the gist of a lecture, you have to understand it in thefirst place. So if you are writing by hand, you are forced to think about whatyou hear (or read) – otherwise you wouldn’t be able to grasp the underlyingprinciple, the idea, the structure of an argument. Handwriting makes purecopying impossible, but instead facilitates the translation of what is said (orwritten) into one’s own words. The students who typed into their laptopswere much quicker, which enabled them to copy the lecture more closely butcircumvented actual understanding. They focused on completeness. Verbatimnotes can be taken with almost no thinking, as if the words are taking a shortcut from the ear to the hand, bypassing the brain.

If you decide to write your notes by hand, just keep them in one place andsort them alphabetically in the usual way: “SurnameYear”. Then you caneasily match them with the bibliographic details in your reference system.But whether you write them by hand or not, keep in mind that it is all aboutthe essence, the understanding and preparation for the next step – thetransferring of ideas into the context of your own lines of thoughts in the slip-box.

#### _10.2 Keep an Open Mind_

While selectivity is the key to smart note-taking, it is equally important to beselective in a smart way. Unfortunately, our brains are not very smart inselecting information by default. While we should seek out dis-confirmingarguments and facts that challenge our way of thinking, we are naturallydrawn to everything that makes us feel good, which is everything thatconfirms what we already believe we know.

The very moment we decide on a hypothesis, our brains automatically gointo search mode, scanning our surroundings for supporting data, which isneither a good way to learn nor research. Worse, we are usually not even aware of this confirmation bias (or myside bias28) that surreptitiouslymeddles with our life. Somehow, we just seem to happen to be surrounded bypeople who all think alike. (Not on purpose, of course. We just spend ourtime with people we like. And why do we like them? Correct: Because theythink like us.) We just seem to happen to read the publications that tend toconfirm what we already know. (Not on purpose, of course. We just try tostick with good, intelligent texts. And what makes us think these texts aregood and intelligent? Correct: because they make sense to us. ) We lookaround and just cut out dis-confirming facts without even noticing what wedon’t see, very much like the same city can one day be full of happy peopleand the other day full of miserable ones, depending on our mood.Confirmation bias is a subtle but major force. As the psychologistRaymond Nickerson puts it: “If one were to attempt to identify a singleproblematic aspect of human reasoning that deserves attention above allothers, the confirmation bias would have to be among the candidates forconsideration” (Nickerson 1998, 175).

Even the best scientists and thinkers are not free from it. What sets themapart is the mere fact that they are aware of the problem and do somethingabout it. The classic role model would be Charles Darwin. He forced himselfto write down (and therefore elaborate on) the arguments that were the mostcritical of his theories. “I had ... during many years followed a golden rule,namely, that whenever a published fact, a new observation or thought cameacross me, which was opposed to my general results, to make a memorandumof it without fail and at once; for I had found by experience that such factsand thoughts were far more apt to escape from the memory than favorableones. Owing to this habit, very few objections were raised against my views, which I had not at least noticed and attempted to answer.” (Darwin 1958). This is a good (primarily mental) technique to deal with confirmation bias.

But we are looking for ways to implement insight into our psychologicallimitations in an external system. We want to make the right decisionswithout too much mental effort – very much like Odysseus, who made itimpossible for himself to follow the luring singing of the Sirens by gettinghimself lashed to the mast of his ship. With a good system, the merenecessities of the workflow will force us to act more virtuously withoutactually having to become more virtuous. Confirmation bias is tackled here intwo steps: First, by turning the whole writing process on its head, andsecondly, by changing the incentives from finding confirming facts to anindiscriminate gathering of any relevant information regardless of whatargument it will support.

The linear process promoted by most study guides, which insanely startswith the decision on the hypothesis or the topic to write about, is a sure-fireway to let confirmation bias run rampant. First, you basically fix your presentunderstanding, as the outcome instead of using it as the starting point,priming yourself for one-sided perception. Then you artificially create aconflict of interest between getting things done (finding support for yourpreconceived argument) and generating insight, turning any departure fromyour preconceived plan into a mutiny against the success of your own project.This is a good rule of thumb: If insight becomes a threat to your academic orwriting success, you are doing it wrong.

Developing arguments and ideas bottom-up instead of top-down is the firstand most important step to opening ourselves up for insight. We should beable to focus on the most insightful ideas we encounter and welcome themost surprising turns of events without jeopardizing our progress or, evenbetter, because it brings our project forward. We postpone the decision onwhat to write about specifically and focus on building a critical mass withinthe slip-box. Instead of having the hypothesis in mind all the time, we wantto:

· Confirm that we have separated tasks and focus on understanding the text
we read,
· Make sure we have given a true account of its content

· Find the relevance of it and make connections.

Only then do we take a step back to look at what developed, then make a decision on what conclusions are to be drawn from that. The slip-box forces us to be selective in reading and note-taking, but the only criterion is the question of whether something adds to a discussion in the slip-box. The only thing that matters is that it connects or is open to connections. Everything can contribute to the development of thoughts within the slip-box: an addition as well as a contradiction, the questioning of a seemingly obvious idea as well as the differentiation of an argument. What we are looking for are facts and information that can add something and therefore enrich the slip-box. One of the most important habitual changes when starting to work with the slip-box is moving the attention from the individual project with our preconceived ideas towards the open connections within the slip-box.

After aligning our interests, we can go a step further and prime ourselves for seeking out dis-confirming facts. Collecting only one-sided ideas wouldn’t be very enriching. Yes, we have to be selective, but not in terms of pros and cons, but in terms of relevant or irrelevant. And as soon we focus on the content of the slip-box, dis-confirming data becomes suddenly very attractive, because it opens up more possible connections and discussions within the slip-box, while mere confirming data does not. It becomes easier to seek out dis-confirming data with practice and can become quite addictive. The experience of how one piece of information can change the whole perspective on a certain problem is exciting. And the more diverse the content of the slip-box is, the further it can bring our thinking forward – provided we haven’t decided on the direction upfront. Contradictions within the slip-box can be discussed on follow-up notes or even in the final paper. It is so much easier to develop an interesting text from a lively discussion with a lot of pros and cons than from a collection of one-sided notes and seemingly fitting quotes. In fact, it is almost impossible to write anything interesting and worth publishing (and therefore motivating) if it is based on nothing else than an idea we were able to come up with up front before elaborating on the problem.

The slip-box is pretty agnostic about the content it is fed. It just prefers relevant notes. It is a fter reading and collecting relevant data, connecting thoughts and discussing how they fit together that it is time to draw conclusions and develop a linear structure for the argument.

#### _10.3 Get the Gist_

The ability to distinguish relevant from less relevant information is another skill that can only be learned by doing. It is the practice of looking for the gist and distinguishing it from mere supporting details. As we are forced to make this distinction when we read with a pen in our hand and write permanent note after permanent note, it is more than mere practice: it is deliberate practice repeated multiple times a day. Extracting the gist of a text or an idea and giving an account in writing is for academics what daily practice on the piano is for pianists: The more often we do it and the more focused we are, the more virtuous we become.

Patterns that help us navigate texts and discourses are not only theories, concepts or the respective terminology, but also typical mistakes we automatically scan an argument for, general categories we apply, writing styles that indicate a certain school of thought or mental models we learn or develop from different insights and can collect like a great and ever- increasing set of thinking tools. Without these tools and reference points, no professional reading or understanding would be possible. We would read every text in the same way: like a novel. But with the learned ability of spotting patterns, we can enter the circle of virtuosity: Reading becomes easier, we grasp the gist quicker, can read more in less time, and can more easily spot patterns and improve our understanding of them. And along the way, we increase our set of thinking tools, which will not only help with academic work, but with thinking and understanding in general. That is why Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman Charlie Munger describes as worldly- wise someone who has a broad set of these tools and knows how to apply them.

But this dynamic can only start if we ourselves deliberately decide to take on the task of reading and being selective about it, relying on nothing other than our own judgement of what is important and what is not. Textbooks or secondary literature in general cannot take this off our hands, and students who solely rely on them have no chance of becoming “worldly wise.” This is not far off from what philosopher Immanuel Kant described in his famous text about the Enlightenment: “Nonage immaturity is the inability to use one’s own understanding without another’s guidance. This nonage is self- imposed if its cause lies not in lack of understanding but in indecision and lack of courage to use one’s own mind without another’s guidance. Dare to know! (Sapere aude.) ‘Have the courage to use your own understanding,’ is therefore the motto of the Enlightenment.” (Kant 1784)

I suggest taking this literally. The ability to use one’s own understanding is a challenge, not a given. Luhmann stresses the importance of permanent notes in this regard:

“The problem with reading academic texts seems to be that we need not the short-term
memory, but the long-term memory to develop reference points for distinguishing the
important things from the less important, the new information from the mere repeated. But it is
of course impossible to remember everything. That would be rote learning. To put it
differently: One has to read extremely selectively and extract widespread and connected
references. One has to be able to follow recurrences. But how to learn it if guidance is
impossible? [...] Probably the best method is to take notes – not excerpts, but condensed
reformulated accounts of a text. Rewriting what was already written almost automatically
trains one to shift the attention towards frames, patterns and categories in the observations, or
the conditions/assumptions, which enable certain, but not other descriptions. It makes sense to
always ask the question: What is not meant, what is excluded if a certain claim is made? If
someone speaks of ‘human rights:’ What distinction is made? A distinction towards ‘non-
human rights?’ ‘Human duties?’ Is it a cultural comparison or one with some historic people
who didn’t have the concept of human rights, but lived okay together anyway? Often, the text
does not give an answer or a clear answer to this question. But then one has to resort to one’s
own imagination.” (Luhmann 2000, 154f)

The better you become in doing this, the quicker you can jot down notes, which are still helpful. Luhmann’s notes are very condensed (Schmidt 2015). With practice comes the ability to find the right words to express something in the best possible way, which means in a simple, but not simplified way. Not only will the readers of your text appreciate your ability to explain something clearly, those you talk to will benefit from this ability as well, as it is not limited to writing. It spills over into speaking and thinking. It is proven that readers regard an author and an audience a speaker as more intelligent the more clear and to the point their expressions are (Oppenheimer 2006). The ability to spot patterns, to question the frames used and detect the distinctions made by others, is the precondition to thinking critically and looking behind the assertions of a text or a talk. Being able to re-frame questions, assertions and information is even more important than having an extensive knowledge, because without this ability, we wouldn’t be able to put our knowledge to use. The good news is that these skills can be learned. But it requires deliberate practice (Ericsson, Krampe, and Tesch-Römer 1993; Anders Ericsson 2008). Taking smart notes is the deliberate practice of these skills. Mere reading, underlining sentences and hoping to remember the content is not.

#### _10.4 Learn to Read_

“If you can’t say it clearly, you don’t understand it yourself.” (John Searle)

Physicist and Nobel Prize winner Richard Feynman once said that he could only determine whether he understood something if he could give an introductory lecture on it. Reading with a pen in your hand is the small-scale equivalent of a lecture. Permanent notes, too, are directed towards an audience ignorant of the thoughts behind the text and unaware of the original context, only equipped with a general knowledge of the field. The only difference is that the audience here consists of our future selves, which will very soon have reached the same state of ignorance as someone who never had access to what we have written about. Of course, it would be helpful to involve other people at all stages of the writing process, because then we can see in their faces how well we have put something or how convincing our arguments are, but that is rather impractical.

Also, we shouldn’t underestimate the advantages of writing. In oral presentations, we easily get away with unfounded claims. We can distract from argumentative gaps with confident gestures or drop a casual “you know what I mean” irrespective of whether we know what we meant. In writing, these manoeuvres are a little too obvious. It is easy to check a statement like: “But that is what I said!” The most important advantage of writing is that it helps us to confront ourselves when we do not understand something as well as we would like to believe.

“The principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool,” Feynman stressed in a speech to young scientists (Feynman 1985, 342). Reading, especially rereading, can easily fool us into believing we understand a text. Rereading is especially dangerous because of the mere- exposure effect: The moment we become familiar with something, we start believing we also understand it. On top of that, we also tend to like it more (Bornstein 1989).

While it is obvious that familiarity is not understanding, we have no chance of knowing whether we understand something or just believe we understand something until we test ourselves in some form. If we don’t try to verify our understanding during our studies, we will happily enjoy the feeling of getting smarter and more knowledgeable while in reality staying as dumb as we were. This warm feeling disappears quickly when we try to explain what we read in our own words in writing. Suddenly, we see the problem. The attempt to rephrase an argument in our own words confronts us without mercy with all the gaps in our understanding. It certainly feels less good, but this struggle is the only chance we have to improve our understanding, to learn and move forward (cf. below). This, again, is deliberate practice. Now we are faced with a clear choice: We have to choose between feeling smarter or becoming smarter. And while writing down an idea feels like a detour, extra time spent, not writing it down is the real waste of time, as it renders most of what we read as ineffectual.

Understanding is not just a precondition to learning something. To a certain degree, learning is understanding. And the mechanisms are not so different, either: We can only improve our learning if we test ourselves on our progress. Here, too, rereading or reviewing does not confront us with the things we haven’t learned yet, although it makes us feel like we have. Only the actual attempt to retrieve information will clearly show us if we have learned something or not. The mere-exposure effect would fool us here, too: Seeing something we have seen before causes the same emotional reaction as if we had been able to retrieve the information from our memory. Rereading, therefore, makes us feel we have learned what we read: “I know that already!” Our brains are terrible teachers in this regard. We face here the same choice between methods that make us feel like we learned something and methods that truly do make us learn something.

If you now think: “That’s ridiculous. Who would want to read and pretend to learn just for the illusion of learning and understanding?” please look up the statistics: The majority of students chooses every day not to test themselves in any way. Instead, they apply the very method research has shown again (Karpicke, Butler, and Roediger 2009) and again (Brown 2014, ch. 1) to be almost completely useless: rereading and underlining sentences for later rereading. And most of them choose that method, even if they are taught that they don’t work. Consciously, we probably would all choose the same, but what really matters are the many small, implicit choices we have to

make every day, and they are most often made unconsciously. This is why choosing an external system that forces us to deliberate practice and confronts us as much as possible with our lack of understanding or not-yet-learned information is such a smart move. We only have to make the conscious choice once.

#### _10.5 Learn by Reading_

Learning itself requires deliberate practice, and I mean actual learning that helps us to increase our understanding of the world, not just the learning that makes us pass a test. And deliberate practice is demanding; it requires effort. Trying to skip this step would be like going to the gym and trying to work out with the least effort possible. That just doesn’t make sense, just like it wouldn’t make sense to hire a coach to do the heavy lifting. A coach is not there to do the work, but to show us how to use our time and effort in the most effective way. What is self-evident in sports we are only starting to realise is true for learning as well. “The one who does the work does the learning,” writes Doyle (2008, 63). It is hard to believe, but in education that is still a revolutionary idea.

Learning requires effort, because we have to think to understand and we need to actively retrieve old knowledge to convince our brains to connect it with new ideas as cues. To understand how groundbreaking this idea is, it helps to remember how much effort teachers still put into the attempt to make learning easier for their students by prearranging information, sorting it into modules, categories and themes. By doing that, they achieve the opposite of what they intend to do. They make it harder for the student to learn because they set everything up for reviewing, taking away the opportunity to build meaningful connections and to make sense of something by translating it into one’s own language. It is like fast food: It is neither nutritious nor very enjoyable, it is just convenient.

It would be surprising if teachers changed the topic in the middle of the lesson, moving on to the next chapter before anyone had the chance to really understand the first one, only to come back to the previous topic later. It would also be unexpected to test the students constantly, half of the time about things that weren’t even mentioned yet. But as much as it would probably annoy the students, who are used to having their material presented in neat categories, it would force them to make sense of what they encounter

- \*and that would make them really learn it.

“Manipulations such as variation, spacing, introducing contextual interference, and using tests,
rather than presentations, as learning events, all share the property that they appear during the
learning process to impede learning, but they then often enhance learning as measured by
post-training tests of retention and transfer. Conversely, manipulations such as keeping
conditions constant and predictable and massing trials on a given task often appear to enhance
the rate of learning during instruction or training, but then typically fail to support long-term
retention and transfer” (Bjork, 2011, 8).

When we try to answer a question before we know how to, we will laterremember the answer better, even if our attempt failed (Arnold andMcDermott 2013). If we put effort into the attempt of retrieving information,we are much more likely to remember it in the long run, even if we fail toretrieve it without help in the end (Roediger and Karpicke 2006). Evenwithout any feedback, we will be better off if we try to remember somethingourselves (Jang et al. 2012). The empirical data is pretty unambiguous, butthese learning strategies do not necessarily feel right. Intuitively, moststudents resort to cramming, which is just another term for reading somethingagain and again in a failed attempt to learn it (Dunlosky et al. 2013). And asmuch as rereading doesn’t help with learning, it certainly doesn’t help withunderstanding. Admittedly, cramming does get information into your headfor a short while – usually long enough to stay in there to pass a test. Butcramming won’t help you learn. As Terry Doyle and Todd Zakrajsek put it:“If learning is your goal, cramming is an irrational act” (Doyle and Zakrajsek 2013).29

Instead of reviewing a text, you could just as well play a round of ping-pong. In fact, chances are it would help you more because exercise helps totransfer information into long-term memory (cf. Ratey 2008). Plus, exercisereduces stress, which is good, because stress floods our brains with hormonesthat suppress learning processes (Baram et al. 2008).

In short: Pure re-viewing just doesn’t make any sense, neither forunderstanding nor for learning. It is debatable if we even can call it learning.It is not surprising, therefore, that the best-researched and most successfullearning method is elaboration. It is very similar to what we do when we takesmart notes and combine them with others, which is the opposite of mere re-viewing (Stein et al. 1984) Elaboration means nothing other than reallythinking about the meaning of what we read, how it could inform different questions and topics and how it could be combined with other knowledge. Infact, “Writing for Learning” is the name of an “elaboration method” (Gunel,Hand, and Prain 2007). But there is a caveat. Even though elaboration worksverifiably well for deep understanding, it might not be the best choice if youjust want to learn isolated encyclopaedic facts (Rivard 1994). But as long asyou are not striving for a career as a quiz show candidate, why would youwant that, anyway? The slip-box takes care of storing facts and information.Thinking and understanding is what it can’t take off your shoulders, which iswhy it makes sense to focus on this part of the work. That it facilitateslearning as well is a nice side effect. Luhmann almost never read a text twice(Hagen 1997) and was still regarded as an impressive conversation partner who seemed to have all information ready to hand.30

Working with the slip-box, therefore, doesn’t mean storing information inthere instead of in your head, i.e. not learning. On the contrary, it facilitatesreal, long-term learning. It just means not cramming isolated facts into yourbrain – something you probably wouldn’t want to do anyway. The objectionthat it takes too much time to take notes and sort them into the slip-box istherefore short-sighted. Writing, taking notes and thinking about how ideasconnect is exactly the kind of elaboration that is needed to learn. Not learningfrom what we read because we don’t take the time to elaborate on it is thereal waste of time.

There is a clear division of labour between the brain and the slip-box: Theslip-box takes care of details and references and is a long-term memoryresource that keeps information objectively unaltered. That allows the brainto focus on the gist, the deeper understanding and the bigger picture, andfrees it up to be creative. Both the brain and the slip-box can focus on whatthey are best at. ^Ch10-Sec5-Par3

### 11 Take Smart Notes

The educational psychologist Kirsti Lonka compared the reading approach ofunusually successful doctoral candidates and students with those who weremuch less successful. One difference stood out as critical: The ability to thinkbeyond the given frames of a text (Lonka 2003, 155f).

Experienced academic readers usually read a text with questions in mindand try to relate it to other possible approaches, while inexperienced readerstend to adopt the question of a text and the frames of the argument and take itas a given. What good readers can do is spot the limitations of a particularapproach and see what is not mentioned in the text.

Even more problematic than staying within the given frame of a text or anargument is the inability to interpret particular information in the text withinthe bigger frame or argument of the text. Even doctoral students sometimesjust collect de-contextualised quotes from a text – probably the worst possibleapproach to research imaginable. This makes it almost impossible tounderstand the actual meaning of information. Without understandinginformation within its context, it is also impossible to go beyond it, toreframe it and to think about what it could mean for another question.Jerome Bruner, a psychologist Lonka refers to, goes a step further and saysthat scientific thinking is plainly impossible if we can’t manage to thinkbeyond a given context and we only focus on the information as it is given tous (Bruner, 1973, quoted after ibid.) It is not surprising, therefore, that Lonkarecommends what Luhmann recommends: Writing brief accounts on themain ideas of a text instead of collecting quotes. And she also stresses that itis no less important to do something with these ideas – to think hard abouthow they connect with other ideas from different contexts and could informquestions that are not already the questions of the author of the respectivetext.

This is exactly what we do when we take the next step, in which we writeand add permanent notes to the slip-box. We don’t just play with ideas in ourheads, but do something with them in a very concrete way: We think aboutwhat they mean for other lines of thoughts, then we write this explicitly onpaper and connect them literally with the other notes.

#### _11.1 Make a Career One Note at a Time_

The first time one faces the challenge of writing a long text, say adissertation, it is pretty normal to feel intimidated by the prospective of fillinga few hundred pages with well-conceived ideas, source-based research andcorrect references on every page. If you don’t feel some kind of respect forthis task, there is something wrong with you. On the other hand, most peoplefeel that writing a page a day (and having a day a week off) is quitemanageable, not realising that this would mean finishing a doctoral thesiswithin a year – something that does not happen very often in reality.

The technique of writing a certain amount every day was perfected by Anthony Trollope, one of the most popular and productive authors of the 19thcentury: He would start every morning at 5:30 a.m. with a cup of coffee and aclock in front of him. Then he would write at least 250 words every 15minutes. This, he writes in his autobiography: “allowed me to produce overten pages of an ordinary novel volume a day, and if kept up through tenmonths, would have given as its results three novels of three volumes each inthe year” (Trollope, 2008, 272). And that, mind you, was before breakfast.Academic or nonfiction texts are not written like this because in addition tothe writing, there is the reading, the research, the thinking and the tinkeringwith ideas. And they almost always take significantly more time thanexpected: If you ask academic or nonfiction writers, students or professorshow much time they expect it would take them to finish a text, theysystematically underestimate the time they need – even when they are askedto estimate the time under the worst-case scenario and if the real conditionsturned out to be quite favourable (Kahneman 2013, 245ff). On top of that:half of all doctoral theses will stay unfinished forever (Lonka, 2003, 113).Academic and nonfiction writing is not as predictable as a Trollope novel andthe work it involves certainly can’t be broken down to something like “onepage a day.”

It does make sense to break down the work into manageable andmeasurable steps, but pages per day don’t work that well as a unit when youalso have to read, do research and think. But even though academic andnonfiction writing involve more of other types of work than fiction writing,Luhmann managed to beat Trollope in productivity if you count his articlesas well as his books. Luhmann wrote 58 books and hundreds of articles, while Trollope wrote 47 novels plus 16 other books. Granted, it might havesomething to do with the fact that Luhmann did some work after breakfast aswell. But the main reason is the slip-box, which compares to Trollope’stechnique as investing with compounded interest compares to a piggy-bank.Trollope is like a diligent saver who puts a little sum to the side every day,which adds up over time toward something impressive. Three dollars putaside each day (say, one takeout coffee) add up over the year to a smallvacation ($1,000) and over a working life to a deposit on a flat as a permanent holiday retreat.31 Putting notes into the slip-box, however, islike investing and reaping the rewards of compounded interest (which would in this example almost pay for the whole flat).32

And likewise, the sum of the slip-box content is worth much more than thesum of the notes. More notes mean more possible connections, more ideas,more synergy between different projects and therefore a much higher degreeof productivity. Luhmann’s slip-box contains about 90,000 notes, whichsounds like an incredibly large number. But it only means that he wrote sixnotes a day from the day he started to work with his slip-box until he died.If you, by any chance, don’t have the ambition to compete with him interms of books per year, you could settle for three notes a day and still buildup a significant critical mass of ideas in a very reasonable time. And youcould settle for less than one book every twelve months. In contrast tomanuscript pages per day, a certain number of notes a day is a reasonablegoal for academic writing. And that is because taking a note and sorting itinto the slip-box can be done in one go, while writing a manuscript pagecould involve weeks and months of preparation involving other tasks as well.You could therefore measure your daily productivity by the number of noteswritten.

#### _11.2 Think Outside the Brain_

Taking literature notes is a form of deliberate practice as it gives us feedbackon our understanding or lack of it, while the effort to put into our own wordsthe gist of something is at the same time the best approach to understandingwhat we read.

Taking permanent notes of our own thoughts is a form of self-testing aswell: do they still make sense in writing? Are we even able to get the thought on paper? Do we have the references, facts and supporting sources at hand?And at the same time, writing it is the best way to get our thoughts in order.Writing here, too, is not copying, but translating (from one context and fromone medium into another). No written piece is ever a copy of a thought in ourmind.

When we take permanent notes, it is much more a form of thinking withinthe medium of writing and in dialogue with the already existing notes withinthe slip-box than a protocol of preconceived ideas. Any thought of a certaincomplexity requires writing. Coherent arguments require the language to befixed, and only if something is written down is it fixed enough to bediscussed independently from the author. The brain alone is too eager tomake us feel good – even if it is by politely ignoring inconsistencies in ourthinking. Only in the written form can an argument be looked at with acertain distance – literally. We need this distance to think about an argument - \*otherwise the argument itself would occupy the very mental resources weneed for scrutinizing it.

As we write notes with an eye towards existing notes, we take more intoaccount than the information that is already available in our internal memory.That is extremely important, because the internal memory retrievesinformation not in a rational or logical way, but according to psycho-logicalrules. The brain also doesn’t store information neurally and objectively. Wereinvent and rewrite our memory every time we try to retrieve information.The brain works with rules of thumb and makes things look as if they fit,even if they don’t. It remembers events that never happened, connectsunrelated episodes to convincing narratives and completes incompleteimages. It cannot help but see patterns and meaning everywhere, even in themost random things (cf. Byrne, 2008). The brain, as Kahneman writes, is “amachine for jumping to conclusions” (Kahneman, 2013, 79). And a machinethat is designed for jumping to conclusions is not the kind of machine youwant to rely on when it comes to facts and rationality – at least, you wouldwant to counterbalance it. Luhmann states as clearly as possible: it is notpossible to think systematically without writing (Luhmann 1992, 53). Mostpeople still think about thinking as a purely internal process, and believe thatthe only function of the pen is to put finished thoughts on paper. RichardFeynman once had a visitor in his office, a historian who wanted to interviewhim. When he spotted Feynman’s notebooks, he said how delighted he was to see such “wonderful records of Feynman’s thinking.”

“No, no!” Feynman protested. “They aren’t a record of my thinkingprocess. They are my thinking process. I actually did the work on the paper.”

“Well,” the historian said, “the work was done in your head, but the recordof it is still here.”

“No, it’s not a record, not really. It’s working. You have to work on paper, and this is the paper.”33

This, obviously, was a very important distinction to Feynman, much morethan just a linguistic difference – and for a good reason: It is the distinctionthat makes all the difference when it comes to thinking.

Philosophers, neuroscientists, educators and psychologists like to disagreein many different aspects on how the brain works. But they no longerdisagree when it comes to the need for external scaffolding. Almost all agreenowadays that real thinking requires some kind of externalization, especiallyin the form of writing. “Notes on paper, or on a computer screen ... do notmake contemporary physics or other kinds of intellectual endeavour easier,they make it possible” is one of the key takeaways in a contemporaryhandbook of neuroscientists (Levy 2011, 290) Concluding the discussions inthis book, Levy writes: “In any case, no matter how internal processes areimplemented, insofar as thinkers are genuinely concerned with what enableshuman beings to perform the spectacular intellectual feats exhibited inscience and other areas of systematic enquiry, as well as in the arts, they needto understand the extent to which the mind is reliant upon externalscaffolding.” (Ibid.) In our system, the scaffolding is done explicitly byconnecting the thoughts within the external memory of the slip-box.Luhmann writes: “Somehow one has to mark differences, keep track ofdistinctions, either explicitly or implicitly in concepts,” because only if theconnections are somehow fixed externally can they function as models ortheories to give meaning and continuity for further thinking (Luhmann, 1992,53).

A common way to embed an idea into the context of the slip-box is bywriting out the reasons of its importance for your own lines of thought. Forexample, I recently read the book “Scarcity: Why Having Too Little MeansSo Much” (2013) by Mullainathan and Shafir. They investigate how theexperience of scarcity has cognitive effects and causes changes in decision- making processes. They help the reader understand why people with almostno time or money sometimes do things that don’t seem to make any sense tooutside observers. People facing deadlines sometimes switch franticallybetween all kinds of tasks. People with little money sometimes spend it onseeming luxuries like take-away food. From the outside, it would make moresense to do one thing at a time, or buy food in bulk and cook for yourself.The book is interesting, because the authors don’t question this behaviorrhetorically or even in a judgemental way, but investigate it as a universalhuman phenomenon.

I took some literature notes collecting reasons how and why humans act sovery differently when they experience scarcity. This was step one, done withan eye towards the argument of the book. I had questions in mind like: Is thisconvincing? What methods do they use? Which of the references arefamiliar?

But the first question I asked myself when it came to writing the firstpermanent note for the slip-box was: What does this all mean for my ownresearch and the questions I think about in my slip-box? This is just anotherway of asking: Why did the aspects I wrote down catch my interest?If I were a psychologist, this book would interest me for completelydifferent reasons than if I were a politician or a debt adviser, or if I hadbought it out of personal interest. As someone with a sociological perspectiveon political questions and an interest in the project of a theory of society, myfirst note reads plainly: “Any comprehensive analysis of social inequalitymust include the cognitive effects of scarcity. Cf. Mullainathan and Shafir2013.” This immediately triggers further questions, which I can discuss onfollowing notes, starting with: “Why?”

Now, I already have two notes in my slip-box, based on the literature notesI took while reading the book, but written along the lines of my own thinking.One note states the relevance of the book for my own thinking and oneexplains my idea in more detail. Here I could draw from my literature notesas a source of valuable facts and insight. Even though the answers to thequestion of why scarcity is relevant to the study of social inequality are all inthe book, they are not just there to be copied. They need to be made explicit.That means to think about how the insight into cognitive effects of scarcityaffects the analysis of social inequality.

While I am writing these notes, it becomes obvious that the answer to the question “why” has already triggered more follow-up questions, like: Isn’tthis already discussed in theories of social inequality? If yes: Who discussedit? If not: Why not? And where do I turn to, to find answers to thesequestions? Correct: The first choice for further inquiry is the slip-box. Maybethere is already something on social inequality that helps me to answer thesequestions, or at least an indication of where to look.

By skimming through the slip-box, I might discover that these ideas couldalso be helpful for another topic I haven’t thought about. One example is thequestion of personal responsibility, which is discussed on the example ofobesity and the influence of hormones as a sub-topic to a philosophicaldiscussion on free will. None of it needs to be discussed right away,especially as most of these ideas would require more research and reading.But there is also no reason not to write down these possible connections andcome back to them later, if my research points me back to them. The morenotes the slip-box contains, the more interesting and prolific this step willbecome and the more research questions will be triggered.

Just by writing down these questions and making possible connectionsexplicit in writing are the concepts and theories being investigated. Theirlimitations become as visible as their particular angle on a problem. Byexplicitly writing down how something connects or leads to something else,we force ourselves to clarify and distinguish ideas from each other.

#### _11.3 Learn by not Trying_

“Selection is the very keel on which our mental ship is built. And in this case of memory its
utility is obvious. If we remembered everything, we should on most occasions be as ill off as if
we remembered nothing. It would take as long for us to recall a space of time as it took the
original time to elapse, and we should never get ahead with our thinking.” (William James
1890, 680).

We have seen in the first step that elaboration through taking smart literaturenotes increases the likelihood that we will remember what we read in the longterm. But this was only the first step. Transferring these ideas into thenetwork of our own thoughts, our latticework of theories, concepts andmental models in the slip-box brings our thinking to the next level. Now weelaborate these ideas within different contexts and connect them with otherideas in a durable fashion. The literature notes are going to be archived,which means the ideas would be lost in the reference system if we didn’t do something with them. That is why we transfer them into our externalmemory, the slip-box, with which we have an ongoing dialogue and wherethey can become part of our active set of ideas.

Transferring ideas into the external memory also allows us to forget them.And even though it sounds paradoxical, forgetting actually facilitates long-term learning. It is important to understand why, because there are still manystudents who shy away from using an external memory. They fear that theywould have to choose between remembering things in their heads (whichwouldn’t require an external memory) or in the external memory (which thenwould be forgotten in the internal memory). That this is a false choicebecomes obvious as soon as we understand how our memory truly works.To be able to remember everything and not having to resort to any externalmemory sounds great initially. But you might think differently if you arefamiliar with the story of a man who was really able to remember almosteverything. The reporter Solomon Shereshevsky (Lurija 1987) is one of themost famous figures in the history of psychology. When his supervisor sawthat he didn’t take any notes during their meetings, he first doubtedShereshevsky’s dedication to the job, but shortly after, it was rather his ownsanity that he doubted.

When he confronted Shereshevsky with what seemed to him like lazybehaviour, Shereshevsky started to recount every single word that wasspoken during the meeting and continued to recount verbatim all the meetingsthey had ever had. His colleagues were astonished, but the person mostastonished was Shereshevsky himself. It was the first time he realised thateveryone else seemed to have forgotten almost everything. Even those whohad taken notes couldn’t remember even a fraction of what seemed normalfor him.

Aleksandr Romanovich Luria, the psychologist who subsequently testedhim in all conceivable ways, couldn’t find any of the usual restrictions peoplenormally have in their memories. But it also became clear that this advantagecame at a huge cost: It wasn’t just that Shereshevsky was able to rememberso much, he had trouble forgetting anything. The important things got lostunder a pile of irrelevant details that involuntarily came to his mind.Although he was very good at remembering facts, Shereshevsky was almostincapable of getting the gist of something, the concepts behind the particularsand distinguishing the relevant facts from minor details. He had great trouble relating to literature or poetry. He could repeat a novel word by word, but thegreater meaning would be lost on him. While Romeo and Juliet is for most ofus a story of love and tragedy, for him it would be the story of “Twohouseholds, both alike in dignity, In fair Verona where we lay our scene,From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, Where civil blood makes civilhands unclean...” It should be obvious that for academic thinking and writing,the gift of being able to remember everything is a serious liability.

The science of learning is still undecided on the question of whether we allshare Shereshevsky’s ability to memorise virtually everything we ever haveencountered, but are only better at suppressing it. After all, sometimes wesuddenly remember scenes from the past in great detail, triggered by a cuelike the scent of a madeleine in Proust’s recherche. These moments ofinvoluntary memory might be like small cracks in the mental barrier throughwhich we can catch a glimpse of all the memories we have collected over ourlifetimes, but might never again have access to.

Forgetting, then, would not be the loss of a memory, but the erection of amental barrier between the conscious mind and our long-term memory.Psychologists call this mechanism active inhibition (cf. MacLeod, 2007). It iseasy to understand what it is good for: Without a very thorough filter, ourbrains would constantly be flooded by memories, making it impossible tofocus on anything in our surroundings. That is what Shereshevsky struggledwith in his life: There were moment where he tried to buy an ice cream, butsome random word of the vendor triggered such an enormous amount ofassociations and memories that he would have to leave the shop, sooverwhelming was this experience.

We are very dependent on a subconscious mechanism that reliably inhibitsalmost every memory every moment except the very, very few that are trulyhelpful in a situation. Unfortunately, we cannot just consciously pluck fromour memory what we need like from a folder in an archive. That wouldrequire the memory we can choose from to be already in our conscious mind,which would render the mechanism of remembering redundant.Remembering is the very mechanism to bring a memory back into ourconscious mind. Therefore, Shereshevsky might not have had an ability mostof us do not posses, but lacked an ability we all posses: The ability to forgetsystematically – to inhibit most irrelevant information from beingremembered.

Shereshevsky was still capable of inhibiting information, but even beingmuch less fine-tuned can have serious consequences. Being too oftenoverwhelmed by memories, associations and synesthetic experiences made itdifficult for him to stay in a job and enjoy many of the things we highlyvalue. Above all, it made it almost impossible for him to think in abstractterms.

Robert and Elizabeth Ligon Bjork from the University of Californiasuggest distinguishing between two different measurements when it comes tomemory: Storage strength and retrieval strength (Bjork 2011). They speculatethat storage strength, the ability to store memories, only becomes greater overone’s lifetime. We add more and more information to our long-term memory.Just by looking at the physical capacity of our brains, we can see that wecould indeed probably store a lifetime and a bit of detailed experiences in it(Carey 2014, 42).

It is difficult, if not impossible, to verify this claim, but it does make senseto shift the attention from storage strength to retrieval strength. Learningwould be not so much about saving information, like on a hard disk, butabout building connections and bridges between pieces of information tocircumvent the inhibition mechanism in the right moment. It is about makingsure that the right “cues” trigger the right memory, about how we can thinkstrategically to remember the most useful information when we need it.This is far from self-evident. If we look at the current state of education,especially the learning strategies most students employ, we see that the vastmajority of all learning still aims to improve “storage strength,” even thoughit cannot be improved. It is still mostly about remembering isolated facts andnot so much about building connections. This is what learning psychologistshave rightfully given the derogative term “cramming:” the attempt toreinforce and solidify information in the brain by repetition. It is basicallyhammering facts into the brain as if they were carvings on an ancient stonetablet. Using fancy words and describing it as a “strengthening of theconnections between neurons” does not change the fact that this attempt isfutile.

If we instead focus on “retrieval strength,” we instantly start to thinkstrategically about what kind of cues should trigger the retrieval of a memory.There are no natural cues: Every piece of information can become the triggerfor another piece of information. These can be associations like the scent of a sweet, as the madeleine triggered childhood memories for Proust, but thiskind of flashback is called “involuntary memory” for a reason: we can’tretrieve it on purpose. Then there are the accidental cues that becomeattached to information when we learn something in a particular environment.It is, for example, easier to remember something we have learned in school ifwe are tested for it in the same room with the same noise in the background(Bjork 2011, 14). Likewise, sometimes it is difficult to remember somethingfrom school when we are not sitting in the classroom where we learned it.Obviously, we don’t want to have to rely on cues in the environment. Thisis not only impractical, but highly misleading: If we test ourselves repeatedlyin the same context and environment in which we have learned something, itwould make us overconfident in terms of learning success, because we wouldnot be able to discount the environmental cues that probably won’t exist inthe context in which we want to remember what we learned.

What does help for true, useful learning is to connect a piece ofinformation to as many meaningful contexts as possible, which is what we dowhen we connect our notes in the slip-box with other notes. Making theseconnections deliberately means building up a self-supporting network ofinterconnected ideas and facts that work reciprocally as cues for each other.Mistaking learning with cramming is still very much ingrained in oureducational culture. When Hermann Ebbinghaus, the godfather of learningtheory, tried to understand the basics of learning and measuring learningprogress, he deliberately used meaningless bits of information like randomletter combinations and made sure they bore no accidental meaning. From hisunderstanding, meaning would distract from the actual learning process. Buthe didn’t realise that he was stripping the learning process from the verything that is learning, which is making meaningful connections.

From the standpoint of evolution, it makes sense that our brains have abuilt-in preference to learn meaningful information and a disregard formeaningless letter combinations. But Ebbinghaus laid the foundation for along-lasting and influential tradition of learning theories that separatesunderstanding from learning.

Our fascination with memory artists can also be explained by this tradition.There is nothing interesting about the capability of a normal person toremember thousands of words, countless facts, numerous subjects, the namesof celebrities, friends, family members and colleagues over a long period of time. But when someone is able to remember a series of twenty or thirtyseemingly meaningless bits of information almost instantly, it fascinates usand reminds us of our struggles at school.

The trick, of course, is not to learn like Ebbinghaus thought we wouldlearn: by banging the information into our heads. Memory artists insteadattach meaning to information and connect it to already known networks ofconnections in a meaningful way. One piece of information can become thecue for another and strings or networks of cues can be built. Those kinds ofmemory techniques are great in case you need to learn information that bearsno meaning in itself or has no logical or meaningful connection to otherthings you already know. But why would you want to learn something likethat – except when you happen to be a memory artist?

Memory techniques are the fix for a rather artificial situation. When itcomes to academic writing, we don't have the need for this trick, as we canchoose to build and think exclusively within meaningful contexts. Abstractinformation like bibliographic references can be stored externally – there isno benefit in knowing them by heart. Everything else better bear meaning.The challenge of writing as well as learning is therefore not so much tolearn, but to understand, as we will already have learned what we understand.The problem is that the meaning of something is not always obvious andneeds to be explored. That is why we need to elaborate on it. But elaborationis nothing more than connecting information to other information in ameaningful way. The first step of elaboration is to think enough about a pieceof information so we are able to write about it. The second step is to thinkabout what it means for other contexts as well.

This is not so different from when elaboration is recommended as a“learning method.” As a method, it has been proven to be more successfulthan any other approach (McDaniel and Donnelly 1996). This is not a newinsight, either. After looking at various studies from the 1960s until the early1980s, Barry S. Stein et al. summarises: “The results of several recent studiessupport the hypothesis that retention is facilitated by acquisition conditionsthat prompt people to elaborate information in a way that increases thedistinctiveness of their memory representations.” (Stein et al. 1984, 522)Stein et al. illustrate how commonsensical this is on the example of abiology novice who learns the difference between veins and arteries: “hemay find it difficult at first to understand and remember that arteries have thick walls, are elastic, and do not have valves, whereas veins are less elastic,have thinner walls, and have valves” (ibid.). But by elaborating a little bit onthis difference and asking the right questions, like “why?” the students canconnect this knowledge with prior knowledge, like their understanding ofpressure and the function of the heart. Just by making the connection to thecommon knowledge that the heart presses the blood into the arteries, theyimmediately know that these walls need to sustain more pressure, whichmeans they need to be thicker than veins, in which the blood flows back tothe heart with less pressure. And, of course, this makes valves necessary tokeep the blood from flowing back. Once understood, the attributes anddifferences are almost impossible to disentangle from the knowledge of veinsand arteries.

Learned right, which means understanding, which means connecting in ameaningful way to previous knowledge, information almost cannot beforgotten anymore and will be reliably retrieved if triggered by the right cues.Moreover, this new learned knowledge can provide more possibleconnections for new information. If you focus your time and energy onunderstanding, you cannot help but learn. But if you focus your time andenergy on learning without trying to understand, you will not only notunderstand, but also probably not learn. And the effects are cumulative.There is a reason why the best scientists are also often very good teachers.For someone like Richard Feynman, everything was about understanding,regardless of whether he was doing research or teaching. His famousFeynman diagrams are primarily tools to make understanding easier and hislectures are famous because they help students to really understand physics.It is not surprising, therefore, that he was passionate about challengingtraditional education methods. He couldn’t stand textbooks full of pseudo-explanations (Feynman 1985) and teachers who tried to make learning easierfor students by using artificial “real-life” examples instead of using theiractual prior understanding as a connection point (Feynman 1963).

Writing notes and sorting them into the slip-box is nothing other than anattempt to understand the wider meaning of something. The slip-box forcesus to ask numerous elaborating questions: What does it mean? How does itconnect to ...? What is the difference between ...? What is it similar to?That the slip-box is not sorted by topics is the precondition for activelybuilding connections between notes. Connections can be made between heterogeneous notes – as long as the connection makes sense. This is the bestantidote to the impeding way most information is given to us in our learninginstitutions. Most often, it comes in modular form, sorted by topic, separatedby disciplines and generally isolated from other information. The slip-box isforcing us to do the exact opposite: To elaborate, to understand, to connectand therefore to learn seriously.

The fact that too much order can impede learning has become more andmore known (Carey 2014). Conversely, we know that the deliberate creationof variations and contrasts can facilitate learning. Nate Kornell and Bjorkshowed this when they experimentally taught students different art styles.First, they used the traditional approach of showing students one art style at atime using different paintings. Then, they deliberately mixed up the stylesand shuffled the paintings around. The students who were presented paintingsfrom different styles in no particular order learned to distinguish styles fasterand were also much more successful at matching paintings to styles andartists they had never seen before. This shows that elaborating on thedifferences and similarities of notes instead of sorting them by topic not onlyfacilitates learning, but facilitates the ability to categorise and create sensibleclassifications!

#### _11.4 Adding Permanent Notes to the Slip-Box_

The next step after writing the permanent notes is to add them to the slip-box.

1. \*Add a note to the slip-box either behind the note you directly refer to or,if you do not follow up on a specific note, just behind the last note in theslip-box. Number it consecutively. The Zettelkasten numbers the notesautomatically. “New note” will just add a note with a new number. If youclick “New note sequence,” the new note will be registered at the sametime as the note that follows the note currently active on the screen. Butyou can always add notes “behind” other notes anytime later. Each notecan follow multiple other notes and therefore be part of different notesequences.
2. Add links to other notes or links on other notes to your new note.
3. Make sure it can be found from the index; add an entry in the index ifnecessary or refer to it from a note that is connected to the index.

4. \*Build a Latticework of Mental Models

### 12 Develop Ideas

“Every note is just an element in the network of references and back references in the system,
from which it gains its quality.” (Luhmann 1992)

Ideally, new notes are written with explicit reference to already existingnotes. Obviously, this is not always possible, especially in the beginningwhen the slip-box is still in its infancy, but it will very soon become the firstoption most of the time. Then you can put the new note “behind” an existing,related note straight away. Luhmann, working with pen and paper, would puta note behind an existing one and number it accordingly. If the existing notebore the number 21, he numbered the new note 22. If note number 22 alreadyexisted, he would still add it behind 21, but number it 21a. By alternatingnumbers and letters, he was able to branch out into an infinite number ofsequences and sub-sequences internally with no hierarchical order.An initial subsequence that attracts more and more follow-up notes caneasily become a main topic with many subtopics over time (Schmidt 2013,172). The digital Zettelkasten makes things easier: numbers are assignedautomatically, note sequences can be constructed any time later and one notecan become the follow-up note to different notes at the same time.These note sequences are the backbone of text development. They combinethe advantages of an abstract with a topic-related order. A pure topic-relatedorder would have to be organised top down and requires a hierarchical orderup front. A pure abstract order would not allow idea clusters and topics to bebuilt bottom up. The individual notes would stay mostly independent andisolated with only one-dimensional references – pretty much like a one-person Wikipedia stripped of the knowledge and fact-checking abilities of thecommunity.

But a loose order of sequences allows freedom to change course whennecessary and provides enough structure to build up complexity. Notes areonly as valuable as the note and reference networks they are embedded in.Because the slip-box is not intended to be an encyclopaedia, but a tool tothink with, we don’t need to worry about completeness. We don’t need towrite anything down just to bridge a gap in a note sequence. We only write ifit helps us with our own thinking. The gaps we do need to concern ourselves with are the gaps in the arguments in the final manuscript – but these gapswill only become obvious in the next step, when we take the relevant notesfor an argument out of the network of the slip-box and sort them into thelinear order for the rough draft.

As the slip-box is not a book with just one topic, we don’t need to have anoverview of it. On the contrary, we are much better off accepting as early aspossible that an overview of the slip-box is as impossible as having anoverview of our own thinking while we are thinking. As an extension of ourown memory, the slip-box is the medium we think in , not something we thinkabout. The note sequences are the clusters where order emerges fromcomplexity. We extract information from different linear sources and mix itall up and shake it until new patterns emerge. Then, we form these patternsinto new linear texts.

#### _12.1 Develop Topics_

After adding a note to the slip-box, we need to make sure it can be foundagain. This is what the index is for. Luhmann wrote an index with atypewriter on index cards. In the Zettelkasten, keywords can easily be addedto a note like tags and will then show up in the index. They should be chosencarefully and sparsely. Luhmann would add the number of one or two (rarelymore) notes next to a keyword in the index (Schmidt 2013, 171). The reasonhe was so economical with notes per keyword and why we too should be veryselective lies in the way the slip-box is used. Because it should not be used asan archive, where we just take out what we put in, but as a system to thinkwith, the references between the notes are much more important than thereferences from the index to a single note. Focusing exclusively on the indexwould basically mean that we always know upfront what we are looking for –we would have to have a fully developed plan in our heads. But liberating ourbrains from the task of organizing the notes is the main reason we use theslip-box in the first place.

The file-box can do much more than just hand out what we request. It cansurprise and remind us of long-forgotten ideas and trigger new ones. Thiscrucial element of surprise comes into play on the level of the interconnectednotes, not when we are looking for particular entries in the index. Most noteswill be found through other notes. The organisation of the notes is in thenetwork of references in the slip-box, so all we need from the index are entry

points. A few wisely chosen notes are sufficient for each entry point. Thequicker we get from the index to the concrete notes, the quicker we move ourattention from mentally preconceived ideas towards the fact-rich level ofinterconnected content, where we can conduct a fact-based dialogue with theslip-box.

Even though we will not get an overview of the whole slip-box (as wecertainly will never get an overview of our whole internal memory), we canget an overview of a specific topic. But because the structure of topics andsubtopics is not a given, but the outcome of our thinking, they too are subjectto ongoing considerations and alteration. The consideration of how tostructure a topic, therefore, belongs on notes as well – and not on a meta-hierarchical level. We can provide ourselves with a (temporarily valid)overview over a topic or subtopic just by making another note. If we then linkfrom the index to such a note, we have a good entry point. If the overview onthis note ceases to correctly represent the state of a cluster or topic, or wedecide it should be structured differently, we can write a new note with abetter structure and update the respective link from the index. This isimportant: Every consideration on the structure of a topic is just anotherconsideration on a note – bound to change and dependent on the developmentof our understanding.

The way people choose their keywords shows clearly if they think like anarchivist or a writer. Do they wonder where to store a note or how to retrieveit? The archivist asks: Which keyword is the most fitting? A writer asks: Inwhich circumstances will I want to stumble upon this note, even if I forgetabout it? It is a crucial difference.Let’s assume I want to add a short note that says: “Tversky/Kahneman(1973) showed in an experiment that people are more likely to overestimatethe likelihood of an event to happen if they are able to conceive it well and indetail than if it were abstract.” If you think in terms of archiving, you mightfeel keywords like “misjudgements,” “experimental psychology” or“experiment” would be fitting. In this case, you would think in generalcategories like “subject,” “discipline” or “method.” It is rather unlikely thatyou will ever think of writing an article based on all notes to “experimentalpsychology” or see the need for retrieving all notes filed under “experiment.”Maybe you will think about a book that collects “misjudgements,” but it isunlikely that you could turn any of these piles of notes into a structured argument.

As writers, we approach the question of keywords differently. We look atour slip-box for already existing lines of thought and think about thequestions and problems already on our minds to which a new note mightcontribute.

If you are an economist working on decision-making, you might think ofthe preferences management often shows for projects with an easy-to-visualise outcome over more profitable ones. A fitting keyword would thenbe “capital allocation problems.” By assigning the keyword alone, the note isalready put into a specific context, which gives it a particular meaning andtriggers context-specific questions like: If this is a systematic effect, can it bemeasured? Has someone already measured it? Does the effect show up inavailable data, like the market value of publicly listed companies, and if so, isit that companies with products that are easy to visualise have richervaluations than those who offer services or products that are rather difficult tograsp? And if not: Is it because the experimental findings cannot beextrapolated or is it because the knowledge is already publicly available andtherefore priced in? If not, is it another argument against the Efficient Markethypothesis or just a good way to stack the odds in the stock market in yourfavour?

By assigning this keyword, you might stumble upon already existing noteson capital allocation, which either help to answer these questions or triggernew ones. But maybe you are a political scientist and read this note as ananswer to the question of why certain topics are discussed during an electionand others not, or why it could be politically more sensible to promote easy-to-visualise solutions over solutions that really work. Fitting keywords heremight be “political strategies,” “elections” or “dysfunctionalities, political.”Keywords should always be assigned with an eye towards the topics youare working on or interested in, never by looking at the note in isolation. Thisis also why this process cannot be automated or delegated to a machine orprogram – it requires thinking. The Zettelkasten does make suggestions basedon existing keywords and scans for keywords in the text you wrote. But itmakes sense to see these suggestions more as a warning sign than aninvitation to use them: these are the most obvious ideas and probably not thebest ones. Good keywords are usually not already mentioned as words in thenote. Assume I have the note “A sudden increase of ad-hoc theories is for Kuhn a sign that a normal-science phase might be in crisis (Kuhn 1967, 96).”

A fitting keyword might be “paradigm change,” but that phrase is not in thenote and therefore would not be suggested by the program.Assigning keywords is much more than just a bureaucratic act. It is acrucial part of the thinking process, which often leads to a deeper elaborationof the note itself and the connection to other notes.

#### _12.2 Make Smart Connections_

In the digital version of the Zettelkasten, all we need to do is to click on“Links” and add the number of the note we want to refer to. It thenautomatically adds a backlink to the note we refer from. Even though theZettelkasten makes suggestions here, too, for example based on jointliterature references, making good cross-references is a matter of seriousthinking and a crucial part of the development of thoughts.Luhmann used four basic types of cross-references in his file-box (Schmidt2013, 173f; Schmidt 2015, 165f). Only the first and last are relevant for thedigital Zettelkasten, the other two are merely compensating for restrictions ofthe analogue pen and paper version. You don’t need to concern yourself withthem if you use the digital program.

1. \*The first type of links are those on notes that are giving you the overviewof a topic. These are notes directly referred to from the index and usuallyused as an entry point into a topic that has already developed to such adegree that an overview is needed or at least becomes helpful. On a notelike this, you can collect links to other relevant notes to this topic orquestion, preferably with a short indication of what to find on these notes(one or two words or a short sentence is sufficient). This kind of note helpsto structure thoughts and can be seen as an in-between step towards thedevelopment of a manuscript. Above all, they help orientate oneself withinthe slip-box. You will know when you need to write one. Luhmanncollected up to 25 links to other notes on these kind of entry notes. Theydon’t have to be written in one go as links can be added over time, whichagain shows how topics can grow organically. What we think is relevantfor a topic and what is not depends on our current understanding andshould be taken quite seriously: It defines an idea as much as the facts it isbased on. What we regard as being relevant for a topic and how we structure it will change over time. This change might lead to another note
   with a different, more adequate topic structure, which then can be seen as a
   comment on the previous note. Thankfully, it won’t make all the other
   notes redundant. As mentioned before: All we have to do is to change the
   entry in the index to this new note and/or indicate on the old note that we
   now consider a new structure more fitting.

2. \*A similar though less crucial kind of link collection is on those notes thatgive an overview of a local, physical cluster of the slip-box. This is onlynecessary if you work with pen and paper like Luhmann. While the firsttype of note gives an overview of a topic, regardless of where the notes arelocated within the slip-box, this type of note is a pragmatic way of keepingtrack of all the different topics discussed on the notes that are physicallyclose together. As Luhmann put notes between notes to internally branchout subtopics and sub-subtopics, original lines of thoughts were ofteninterrupted by hundreds of different notes. This second type of note keepstrack of the original lines of thought. Obviously, we don’t need to worryabout this if we work with the digital version.

3. Equally less relevant for the digital version are those links that indicatethe note to which the current note is a follow-up and those links thatindicate the note that follows on the current note. Again, this is onlyrelevant to see which notes follow each other, even if they don’t physicallystand behind each other anymore. The digital Zettelkasten automaticallyadds these kinds of backlinks and presents you the relevant notes in a notesequence.

4. The most common form of reference is plain note-to-note links. Theyhave no function other than indicating a relevant connection between twoindividual notes. By linking two related notes regardless of where they arewithin the slip-box or within different contexts, surprising new lines ofthought can be established. These note-to-note links are like the “weaklinks” (Granovetter 1973) of social relationships we have withacquaintances: even though they are usually not the ones we turn to first,they often can offer new and different perspectives.

These links can help us to find surprising connections and similaritiesbetween seemingly unrelated topics. Patterns might not become visible right away, but they might emerge after multiple note-to-note links between twotopics have been established. It is no coincidence that one of the mainfeatures of Luhmann’s theory of social systems is its discovery of structuralpatterns that could be found in very different parts of society. For example,he was able to show how vastly different things like money, power, love,truth and justice can be seen as social inventions that solve structurallysimilar problems (they all can be seen as media that make the acceptance ofcertain communication offers more likely, cf. Luhmann 1997, chapter 9–12).Observations like these could never be done nor explained by someone whois working with a system that keeps things neatly separated by preconceivedthemes and topics.

It is important to always keep in mind that making these links is not achore, a kind of file-box maintenance. The search for meaningful connectionsis a crucial part of the thinking process towards the finished manuscript. Buthere, it is dealt with in a very concrete way. Instead of figuratively searchingour internal memory, we literally go through the file-box and look forconnections. By dealing with actual notes, we are also less prone to imagineconnections where there aren’t any, as we can see in black and white ifsomething makes sense or not.

As we are making these connections, we build up an internal structure ofthe slip-box, which is shaped by our thinking. While this structure builds upexternally and independently of our limited memory, it will, in return, shapeour thinking as well and help us to think in a more structured way. Our ideaswill be rooted in a network of facts, thought-through ideas and verifiablereferences. The slip-box is like a well-informed but down-to-earthcommunication partner who keeps us grounded. If we try to feed it somelofty ideas, it will force us to check first: What is the reference? How doesthat connect to the facts and the ideas you already have?

#### _12.3 Compare, Correct and Differentiate_

If you use the slip-box for a while, you will inevitably make a soberingdiscovery: The great new idea you are about to add to the slip-box turns outto be already in there. Even worse, chances are this idea wasn’t even yours,but someone else’s. Having the same thought twice or mistaking anotherperson’s idea with our own is far from unusual. Unfortunately, most peoplenever notice this humbling fact because they have no system that confronts them with already thought thoughts. If we forget about an idea and have itagain, our brains get as excited as if we are having it the first time. Therefore,working with the slip-box is disillusioning, but at the same time it increasesthe chance that we actually move forward in our thinking towards unchartedterritory, instead of just feeling like we are moving forward.

Sometimes, the confrontation with old notes helps to detect differences wewouldn’t have noticed otherwise. What seems to be the same idea sometimesturns out to be slightly, but crucially, different. We then can explicitly discussthis difference on another note. This is especially helpful when two authorsuse the same concept in slightly different ways. The clarification ofdifferences in the use of words and concepts is a major part of every seriousacademic work anyway – but it is so much easier if you have a nit-pickingpartner like the slip-box. If we had written just excerpts or notes that we hadkept in separate places, these differences would only become obvious if wehad all the relevant notes on our minds at the same time. It is much easier todetect these small but crucial differences when we literally have our notes infront of our eyes, comparing them during our attempts to connect them. Thebrain is very good at making associations and spotting patterns andsimilarities between seemingly different things and also very good in spottingdifferences between seemingly similar things, but it needs to have thempresented objectively and externally. It is much easier to see differences andsimilarities than to detect them by mere thinking.

Comparing notes also helps us to detect contradictions, paradoxes oroppositions – important facilitators for insight. When we realise that we usedto accept two contradicting ideas as equally true, we know that we have aproblem – and problems are good because we now have something to solve.A paradox can be a sign that we haven’t thought thoroughly enough about aproblem or, conversely, that we exhausted the possibilities of a certainparadigm. Finally, oppositions help to shape ideas by providing contrast.Albert Rothenberg suggests that the construction of oppositions is the mostreliable way of generating new ideas (Rothenberg 1971; 1996; 2015).The constant comparing of notes also serves as an ongoing examination ofold notes in a new light. I am surprised how often the addition of one noteleads to a correction, a complementation or an improvement of old ideas.Sometimes, we discover that the source given in a text is not the actualsource. Sometimes, we discover that the interpretation of a study conflicts with another interpretation, making us realise that the study is so vague that itcan be used as proof for two contradicting interpretations. Sometimes, wefind two unrelated studies that give proof to the same point, which is not acorrection, but an indication that we are on to something. Adding new notesto old notes and being forced to compare them leads not only to a constantimprovement of one’s own work, but often discloses weaknesses in the textswe read. We have to compensate for that by being extra critical as readersand careful with extracting information from texts, and we always have to check the original source of a claim.34

The slip-box not only confronts us with dis-confirming information, butalso helps with what is known as the feature-positive effect (Allison andMessick 1988; Newman, Wolff, and Hearst 1980; Sainsbury 1971). This isthe phenomenon in which we tend to overstate the importance of informationthat is (mentally) easily available to us and tilts our thinking towards the mostrecently acquired facts, not necessarily the most relevant ones. Withoutexternal help, we would not only take exclusively into account what we know, but what is on top of our heads.35 The slip-box constantly remindsus of information we have long forgotten and wouldn’t remember otherwise –so much so, we wouldn’t even look for it.

#### _12.4 Assemble a Toolbox for Thinking_

Just by working with the slip-box, we retrieve old ideas and facts on anirregular basis and connect them with other bits of information – very muchhow experts recommend we learn (Bjork 2011, 8; Kornell and Bjork 2008).This is also the idea behind flashcards. But even though flashcards are muchmore effective than cramming or reviewing information within the context ofa textbook, they also have a downside: The information on flashcards isneither elaborated on nor embedded in some form of context. Each flashcardstays isolated instead of being connected with the network of theoreticalframes, our experiences or our latticework of mental models. This not onlymakes it much more difficult to learn, but also difficult to understand theimplications and the meaning of information (cf. Birnbaum et al., 2013). Ascientific term or concept only becomes meaningful within the context of atheory – otherwise it would just be a word.

The same is true for everyday situations. Our ability to read a situation or to interpret information depends on our broader knowledge and how we makesense of it. Science and everyday life are in this regard not so different; bothare intertwined. Scientific work is much more pragmatic and less determinedby theory than outsiders would expect (Latour and Woolgar 1979). At thesame time, we use scientific knowledge and theories to make sense of oursurroundings every day. And some theories or theoretical models aresurprisingly versatile, which is why it makes sense to assemble a toolbox ofuseful mental models (Manktelow and Craik 2004) that could help with ourdaily challenges and make sense of the things we learn and encounter.Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett’s partner and vice chairman of BerkshireHathaway, stresses the importance of having a broad theoretical toolbox – notto be a good academic, but to have a good, pragmatic grip on reality. Heregularly explains to students which mental models have proven most usefulto help him understand markets and human behaviour. He advocates lookingout for the most powerful concepts in every discipline and to try tounderstand them so thoroughly that they become part of our thinking. Themoment one starts to combine these mental models and attach one’sexperiences to them, one cannot help but gain what he calls “worldlywisdom.” The importance is to have not just a few, but a broad range ofmental models in your head. Otherwise, you risk becoming too attached toone or two and see only what fits them. You would become the man with ahammer who sees nails everywhere (cf. Maslow, 1966, 15).

Munger writes: “Well, the first rule is that you can’t really know anythingif you just remember isolated facts and try and bang ’em back. If the factsdon’t hang together on a latticework of theory, you don’t have them in ausable form. You’ve got to have models in your head. And you’ve got toarray your experience, both vicarious and direct, on this latticework ofmodels. You may have noticed students who just try to remember and poundback what is remembered. Well, they fail in school and in life. You’ve got tohang experience on a latticework of models in your head.” (Munger 1994).A truly wise person is not someone who knows everything, but someonewho is able to make sense of things by drawing from an extended resource ofinterpretation schemes. This stands in harsh contrast to the common but not-so-wise belief that we need to learn from experience. It is much better tolearn from the experiences of others – especially when this experience isreflected on and turned into versatile “mental models” that can be used in different situations.

When we delegate the storage of knowledge to the slip-box and at the sametime focus on the principles behind an idea while we write, add and connectnotes, when we look for patterns and think beyond the most obviousinterpretation of a note, when we try to make sense of something, combinedifferent ideas and develop lines of thought, we do exactly that: we build up a“latticework of mental models” instead of just “remembering isolated factsand try and bang ’em back.”

The beauty of this approach is that we co-evolve with our slip-boxes: webuild the same connections in our heads while we deliberately develop themin our slip-box – and make it easier to remember the facts as they now have alatticework we can attach them to. If we practice learning not as a pureaccumulation of knowledge, but as an attempt to build up a latticework oftheories and mental models to which information can stick, we enter avirtuous circle where learning facilitates learning.

Helmut D. Sachs puts it like this:

“By learning, retaining, and building on the retained basics, we are creating a rich web ofassociated information. The more we know, the more information (hooks) we have to connectnew information to, the easier we can form long-term memories. ... Learning becomes fun.We have entered a virtuous circle of learning, and it seems as if our long-term memorycapacity and speed are actually growing. On the other hand, if we fail to retain what we havelearned, for example, by not using effective strategies, it becomes increasingly difficult tolearn information that builds on earlier learning. More and more knowledge gaps becomeapparent. Since we can’t really connect new information to gaps, learning becomes an uphillbattle that exhausts us and takes the fun out of learning. It seems as if we have reached thecapacity limit of our brain and memory. Welcome to a vicious circle. Certainly, you wouldmuch rather be in a virtuous learning circle, so to remember what you have learned, you needto build effective long-term memory structures.” (Sachs 2013, 26)

His recommendations for learning read almost like instructions for the slip-box:

1. \*Pay attention to what you want to remember.
2. Properly encode the information you want to keep. (This includesthinking about suitable cues.)
3. Practice recall. (Ibid., 31)

We learn something not only when we connect it to prior knowledge and tryto understand its broader implications (elaboration), but also when we try to

retrieve it at different times (spacing) in different contexts (variation), ideallywith the help of chance (contextual interference) and with a deliberate effort(retrieval). The slip-box not only provides us with the opportunity to learn inthis proven way, it forces us to do exactly what is recommended just by usingit. We have to elaborate on what we read just to be able to write it down andtranslate it into different contexts. We retrieve information from the slip-boxwhenever we try to connect new notes with old notes. Just by doing this, wemix up contexts, shuffle notes and retrieve the information in irregularintervals. And along the way, we further elaborate on the information, whichwe always retrieve deliberately.

#### _12.5 Use the Slip-Box as a Creativity Machine_

“Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something,
they feel a little guilty because they didn’t really do it, they just saw something.” (Steve Jobs)

Many exciting stories from scientific history make us believe that greatinsight comes in a flash. There is the sudden insight of Watson and Crick thatDNA would have to have the form of a double helix or the story of FriedrichAugust Kekulé, who allegedly dreamed of a snake biting its own tail andsuddenly saw the structure of benzene in front of his eyes.

But the reason why Watson and Crick or Kekulé had these insights and nota random person on the street is that they already had spent a very long timethinking hard about the problems, tinkered with other possible solutions andtried countless other ways of looking at the problem. Our fascination withthese stories clouds the fact that all good ideas need time. Even suddenbreakthroughs are usually preceded by a long, intense process of preparation.Being experienced with a problem and intimately familiar with the toolsand devices we work with, ideally to the point of virtuosity, is theprecondition for discovering their inherent possibilities, writes Ludwik Fleck,a historian of science (Fleck 2012, 126). This is true even for purelytheoretical work. Here, too, we need experience until we can “feel our way”around the problems and questions we deal with, even if these things arewords, concepts and notes in a file system. What we learn in practice isalways much more thorough and complex than what we could put into words.That is why even purely theoretical work cannot be reduced to explicitknowledge, which is consciously available. This is especially true for the useof a slip-box. It is the intuition that comes from the intimate knowledge of a practice that can lead us to new insights. We might not be able to explicitlystate why it is more promising to follow one idea instead of another, butbeing experienced, we somehow know – which is enough. Experimentalscientists regularly describe their decision-making process as being based onintuition (Rheinberger 1997), and there is no reason why it should bedifferent in the social sciences. Maybe it is just harder to accept in the socialsciences as we try so hard to be more like natural scientists, who seem to dowithout something as vague as intuition. But intuition is not the opposition torationality and knowledge, it is rather the incorporated, practical side of ourintellectual endeavours, the sedimented experience on which we build ourconscious, explicit knowledge (cf. Ahrens 2014).

Steven Johnson, who wrote an insightful book about how people in scienceand in general come up with genuine new ideas, calls it the “slow hunch.” Asa precondition to make use of this intuition, he emphasises the importance ofexperimental spaces where ideas can freely mingle (Johnson 2011). Alaboratory with open-minded colleagues can be such a space, much asintellectuals and artists freely discussed ideas in the cafés of old Paris. Iwould add the slip-box as such a space in which ideas can mingle freely, sothey can give birth to new ones.

Most often, innovation is not the result of a sudden moment of realization,anyway, but incremental steps toward improvement. Even groundbreakingparadigm shifts are most often the consequence of many small moves in theright direction instead of one big idea. This is why the search for smalldifferences is key. It is such an important skill to see differences betweenseemingly similar concepts, or connections between seemingly differentideas. This even used to be the meaning of the word “new.” “Novus,” inLatin, used to mean “different,” “unusual,” not so much “genuinely new” inthe meaning of “unheard” (Luhmann, 2005, 210). To have concrete notes infront of our eyes and be able to compare them directly makes differences,even small ones, much easier to spot. (This is an advantage of the originalpaper slip-box, as you can spread out multiple notes on a desk instead of justseeing them on a computer screen.) The neurobiologist James Zull points outthat comparing is our natural form of perception, where our cognitiveinterpretation is in lockstep with our actual eye movements. Therefore,comparing should be understood quite literally.

We even compare when we focus on one thing: “Paying attention does not mean unrelenting attention on one focal point. Our brains evolved to noticedetails by shifting focus from one area to another, by repeatedly scanning thesurroundings. ... The brain is more likely to notice details when it scans thanwhen it focuses.” (Zull 2002, 142f) This is one of the reasons why thinkingworks so much better when we have the very things we think about in frontof our eyes. It is in our nature.

#### _12.6 Think Inside the Box_

“[C]reative people are better at recognizing relationships, making associations and
connections and seeing things in an original way—seeing things that others cannot see“
(Andreasen 2014).

Comparing, differentiating and connecting notes are the basis of goodacademic writing, but playing and tinkering with ideas is what leads toinsight and exceptional texts.

To be able to play with ideas, we first have to liberate them from theiroriginal context by means of abstraction and re-specification. We did thiswhen we took literature notes and translated them into the different contextswithin the slip-box. Abstraction does not have a good reputation at themoment. It is the tangible, the concrete that is cheered for. Abstraction shouldindeed not be the final goal of thinking, but it is a necessary in-between stepto make heterogeneous ideas compatible. If Darwin had never abstractedfrom his concrete observations of sparrows, he would never have found anabstract, a general principle of evolution across different species, and hewould never have been able to see how evolution works in other species aswell. Abstraction is also not for theoretical-academic processes of insightonly. We need to abstract from concrete situations every day. Only byabstraction and re-specification can we apply ideas in the singular and alwaysdifferent situations in reality (Loewenstein, 2010).

Even very personal, intimate experiences, like encounters with art, requireabstraction. If the story of Romeo and Juliet touches us, it is certainly notbecause we are all members of one of two feuding families in Verona. Weabstract from time and place, from the particular circumstances until we canmeet the protagonists of this story on a general level where our ownemotional life can resonate with what we see on stage. The tendency tojuxtapose abstraction with being worldly or to associate it withintellectualism and juxtapose it with being solution-orientated is very misleading indeed.

Studies on creativity with engineers show that the ability to find not onlycreative, but functional and working solutions for technical problems is equalto the ability to make abstractions. The better an engineer is at abstractingfrom a specific problem, the better and more pragmatic his solutions will be –even for the very problem he abstracted from (Gassmann and Zeschky, 2008,103). Abstraction is also the key to analyse and compare concepts, to makeanalogies and to combine ideas; this is especially true when it comes tointerdisciplinary work (Goldstone and Wilensky 2008).

Being able to abstract and re-specify ideas is, again, only one side of theequation. It is not good for anything if we don’t have a system in place thatallows us to put this into practice. Here, it is the concrete standardization ofnotes in just one format that enables us to literally shuffle them around, toadd one idea to multiple contexts and to compare and combine them in acreative way without losing sight of what they truly contain.

Creativity cannot be taught like a rule or approached like a plan. But wecan make sure that our working environment allows us to be creative withideas. It also helps to keep in mind some creativity-inducing ideas aboutproblem-solving that might be counterintuitive. It is worth it to dwell on thissubject a little bit before we move on to the next step: the preparation of therough draft of the manuscript.

The real enemy of independent thinking is not an external authority, butour own inertia. The ability to generate new ideas has more to do withbreaking with old habits of thinking than with coming up with as many ideasas possible. For obvious reasons, I do not recommend “thinking outside thebox”. On the contrary, we can turn the slip-box into a tool for breaking out ofour own thinking habits.

Our brains just love routines. Before new information prompts our brainsto think differently about something, they make the new information fit intothe known or let it disappear completely from our perception. Usually, wedon’t even notice when our brains modify our surroundings to make it fit itsexpectations. We need therefore a bit of a ruse to break the power of thinkingroutines. In their book with the showy title “The 5 Elements of EffectiveThinking”, the mathematicians Edward B. Burger and Michael Starbirdcollected different strategies to do that (2012). Some are already technicallyimplemented in the slip-box, others are good to keep in mind.

For example, they emphasise the importance of feedback loops and theneed to find ways to confront ourselves with our errors, mistakes andmisunderstandings. This is a built-in feature of the slip-box. Another habit ofthe effective thinkers they highlight is their ability to focus on the main ideasbehind the details, to grasp the gist of something. This, too, is something theslip-box nudges us to do.

Another piece of advice is not a feature of the slip-box and might soundbanal, but it is crucial: Make sure that you really see what you think you seeand describe it as plainly and factually as possible. Double-check ifnecessary. That this isn’t as obvious as it sounds will become clearer by thefact that the ability to truly see what is in front of one’s eyes is often listed asa trait of experts. And that is easily explained by the fact that our perceptiondoes not follow the order of seeing first and interpreting second. It does bothat the same time: We always perceive something as something – ourinterpretation is instantaneous. This is why we have so much trouble notfalling for an optical illusion: If we look at a three-dimensional drawing, wecannot see it just as an arrangement of lines and shapes – unless we arehighly trained to do so. We don’t even notice objectively missing parts in ourperception, like the blind spot in the middle of everything we see. We need atrick to see what we don’t see. As we always immediately see a whole pictureof something, everything else, including the reinterpretation of it or thedetection of missing bits, is a step that follows.

The same is true when we read: We don’t see lines on a paper first, thenrealise that these are words, then use them to build sentences and finallydecipher the meaning. We immediately read on the level of meaningfulunderstanding. To really understand a text is therefore a constant revision ofour first interpretation. We have to train ourselves to get used to seeing thisdifference and to hold back our ingrained urge to jump to conclusions. To beable to see what we see instead of what we expect to see is indeed a skill initself, not like a character trait of being “open-minded.” Those who think ofthemselves as being open-minded are often even more prone to stick to theirfirst understanding as they believe to be without natural prejudices andtherefore don’t see the need to counterbalance them. If we think we can “holdback” an interpretation, we are fooling ourselves.

While the constant comparison of notes can help us to detect differences,no technique can help us see what is missing. But we can make it a habit to always ask what is not in the picture, but could be relevant. This, too, doesnot come naturally to us.

One of the most famous figures to illustrate this skill is the mathematicianAbraham Wald (Mangel and Samaniego 1984). During World War II, he wasasked to help the Royal Air Force find the areas on their planes that weremost often hit by bullets so they could cover them with more armour. Butinstead of counting the bullet holes on the returned planes, he recommendedarmouring the spots where none of the planes had taken any hits. The RAFforgot to take into account what was not there to see: All the planes thatdidn’t make it back.

The RAF fell for a common error in thinking called survivorship bias(Taleb 2005). The other planes didn’t make it back because they were hitwhere they should have had extra protection, like the fuel tank. The returningplanes could only show what was less relevant.

Product developers make the same mistake on such a regular basis, one hasto wonder if they do it on purpose. As marketing expert Robert McMathassembled the biggest-ever collection of supermarket products, he realisedmidway it was becoming almost exclusively a collection of failed productsbecause they make up the vast majority of all products ever produced. Hethought a museum would be a great place for product developers to see whatalready proved not to work so they didn’t have to repeat the same mistake.Alas, rarely does a product developer show any interest in learning from theexperience of others. Often, companies don’t even keep track of their ownfailed attempts, providing McMath with whole series in which one kind ofmistake was made in multiple variations, sometimes from each generation ofdevelopers in the same company (McMath and Forbes 1999).

In his beautifully titled book “The Antidote: Happiness for People WhoCan’t Stand Positive Thinking,” Oliver Burkeman describes how much ourculture is focused on success and how we neglect the important lessons fromfailure (Burkeman 2013). Manager biographies are a good example: Eventhough all of them contain some anecdotes about setbacks, these are alwaysembedded in a bigger story about success (failed managers unfortunatelyrarely write biographies). If we try to extract a lesson from all these books,we might end up believing that persistence and charisma are paramount forsuccess, even though these are exactly the same ingredients needed to screw aproject up big time (Burkeman is referring to Jerker Denrell here). Obviously, the same is true in research: It is very good to know what has already provento not work if we try to come up with new ideas that do work.One possibility to deal with this tendency is to ask counterfactualquestions, like “what if?” (Markman, Lindberg, Kray and Galinsky, 2007). Itis easier to learn about the function of money in a society if we wonder howstrangers would exchange goods without using money than if we just focuson the obvious problems we have in a society based on money exchange.Sometimes, it is more important to rediscover the problems for which wealready have a solution than to think solely about the problems that arepresent to us.

Problems rarely get solved directly, anyway. Most often, the crucial stepforward is to redefine the problem in such a way that an already existingsolution can be employed. The first question should always be directedtowards the question itself: What kind of answer can you expect from askinga question in this particular way? What is missing?

Another seemingly banal tip relates to a distinguishing feature ofextraordinary thinkers: Taking simple ideas seriously. Consider, for example,the idea of buying stocks low and selling them high. I am sure everyone cangrasp that idea. But grasping an idea is not the same as understanding it. Ifyou go and buy stocks on that “insight,” all you can do is to hope that a stockgoes up after you buy it, which makes this knowledge about as useful as thetip on the next colour to choose on a roulette table.

The next level of understanding is reached when you realise what you buyif you buy a stock: a part of a company. Nobody would sign a contract for ahouse and believe it is the contract he owns now. But many people treat astock exactly like this. They don’t really think about what they get for theprice they pay: they just assume they made a good deal when the price islower than the day before. But the only thing Warren Buffett thinks about it isthe relationship between price and value – he doesn’t even look at the pricefrom yesterday. He understands that simple is not the same as easy, and thatthe worst thing you can do is to make a simple task unnecessarilycomplicated. A stock is a share in a company. The price is set by the market,which means by supply and demand, which touches on the rationality ofmarket participants as well as the question of valuation, which means youhave to understand something about the business you are consideringinvesting in, including competition, competitive advantages, technological developments, etc.

Making things more complicated than they are can be a way to avoid theunderlying complexity of simple ideas. This is what happened during thefinancial crisis of 2008: Economists developed hugely complicated products,but did not take into account the simple fact that price and value are notnecessarily the same. There is a reason why Buffett is not only a greatinvestor, but also a great teacher: He not only has a vast knowledge abouteverything related to business, he can also explain it all in simple terms.Sometimes the breakthrough in a scientific process is the discovery of asimple principle behind a seemingly very complicated process. Burger andStarbird remind us of the long history of human attempts to fly: We tried toemulate birds by flapping wing-like apparatuses with feathers and all, but inthe end, it was about not getting distracted by details and discovering that thesubtle bending of the wing is the only thing that counts.

Simple ideas can be tied together into consistent theories and build upenormous complexity. This just doesn’t work with complicated ideas. Byusing the slip-box on a daily basis, we train these important intellectual skillsdeliberately: We check if what we understood from a text is really in the textby having our understanding in written form in front of our eyes. We learn tofocus on the gist of an idea by restricting ourselves in terms of space. We canmake it a habit to always think about what is missing when we write downour own ideas. And we can practice asking good questions when we sort ournotes into the slip-box and connect them with other notes.

#### _12.7 Facilitate Creativity through Restrictions_

The slip-box imposes quite a few restrictions on its user. Instead of havingthe choice between all kinds of fancy notebooks, papers or writing formats,or being able to employ the whole range of productivity tools available fornote-taking, learning and academic or nonfiction writing, everything isreduced to a single plain-text format and collected in a single simple slip-boxsystem with no frills or features. Even the computer program basically justemulates a wooden box filled with plain, consecutively numbered paper. Andeven though the digital program lifts the physical restrictions on the length ofa note, I highly recommend treating a digital note as if the space were limited.By restricting ourselves to one format, we also restrict ourselves to just oneidea per note and force ourselves to be as precise and brief as possible. The restriction to one idea per note is also the precondition to recombine themfreely later. Luhmann choose notes in the format A6. A good rule of thumbfor working with the program is: Each note should fit onto the screen andthere should be no need of scrolling.

Standardised is also the way we treat literature and our own thoughts:Instead of using different kinds of notes or techniques for different kinds oftexts or ideas, the approach here is always the same, simple one. Literature iscondensed on a note saying, “On page x, it says y,” and later stored with thereference in one place. Ideas and thoughts are captured on the slip-box notesand connected to other notes always in the same way in the same place.

These standardizations make it possible that the technical side of note-takingcan become automatic. Not having to think about the organisation is reallygood news for brains like ours – the few mental resources we have available,we need for thinking about the actual relevant questions: those concerning thecontents.

This kind of self-imposed restriction is counterintuitive in a culture wheremore choice is usually regarded as a good thing and more tools to choosefrom seen as better than having less at hand. But not having to makedecisions can be quite liberating. In his book “The Paradox of Choice,” BarrySchwartz used numerous examples, from shopping to career options toromance, to show that less choice can not only increase our productivity, butalso our freedom and make it easier to be in the moment and enjoy it(Schwartz, 2007). Not having to make choices can unleash a lot of potential,which would otherwise be wasted on making these choices. Academicwriting should definitely be added to Schwartz’ list of examples in which lesschoice is better.

The formal standardization of the slip-box might seem to be at odds withour search for creativity. But here, too, it is more likely the opposite is true.Thinking and creativity can flourish under restricted conditions and there areplenty of studies to back that claim (cf. Stokes 2001; Rheinberger 1997). Thescientific revolution started with the standardization and controlling ofexperiments, which made them comparable and repeatable (cf. Shapin, 1996).Or think of poetry: It imposes restrictions in terms of rhythm, syllables orrhymes. Haikus give the poet very little room for formal variations, but thatdoesn’t mean they are equally limited in terms of poetic expressiveness. Onthe contrary: It is the strict formalism that allows them to transcend time and culture.

Language in itself is extremely standardised and limited in many ways. Weare restricted to the use of only 26 letters, but what that enables us to do! Wecan write novels, theories, love letters or court orders – just by rearrangingthese 26 letters. This is certainly not possible despite the restriction to 26letters, but because of it. Nobody will open a book and wish it contains moretypes of letters or be disappointed because it is, again, just another variation of the same alphabet.36

A clear structure allows us to explore the internal possibilities ofsomething. Even the act of breaking with convention depends on it. Thelimitation of the canvas does not make the artistic expressions of paintersseem limited, but opens up the possibility of an artist like Lucio Fontana tocut into the canvas instead of painting on it. It is not even true that a morecomplex structure provides more possibilities. Quite the contrary. The binarycode is radically more limited than the alphabet as it contains only two states,one or zero, but it opened up a range of creative possibilities that isunprecedented.

The biggest threat to creativity and scientific progress is therefore theopposite: a lack of structure and restrictions. Without structure, we cannotdifferentiate, compare or experiment with ideas. Without restrictions, wewould never be forced to make the decision on what is worth pursuing andwhat is not. Indifference is the worst environment for insight. And the slip-box is, above all, a tool for enforcing distinctions, decisions and makingdifferences visible. One thing is for sure: the common idea that we shouldliberate ourselves from any restrictions and “open ourselves up” to be morecreative is very misleading indeed (Dean 2013, 201).

### 13 Share Your Insight

“Writing itself makes you realise where there are holes in things. I’m never sure what I think
until I see what I write. And so I believe that, even though you’re an optimist, the analysis part
of you kicks in when you sit down to construct a story or a paragraph or a sentence. You think,
‘Oh, that can’t be right.’ And you have to go back, and you have to rethink it all.” (Carol
Loomis)[37]

Since writing is nothing more than the revision of a rough draft, which isnothing more than turning a series of notes into a continuous text, which arewritten on a day-to-day basis, connected and indexed in the slip-box, there isno need to worry about finding a topic to write about. Just look into your slip-box and see where clusters have been built up. These clusters are what caughtyour interest again and again, so you already know that you have foundmaterial to work with. Now you can spread out these notes on your desktopor use the outliner of the Zettelkasten, outline your argument and construct apreliminary order of sections, chapters or paragraphs. This will makequestions, which are not answered, obvious, and it will show the gaps in theargument that need to be filled and make visible which parts still need somework.

The perspective changes another time: Now, it is not about understandingsomething in the context of another author’s argument, and it is also notabout looking for multiple connections in the slip-box, but about developingone argument and bringing it into the linearity of a manuscript. Instead ofwidening the perspective to find as many possible lines of thought to whichan idea might contribute, it is now about narrowing the perspective, making adecision on one topic only and cutting out everything that does not directlycontribute to the development of the text and support the main argument.

#### _13.1 From Brainstorming to Slip-box-Storming_

“Remember the lesson: ‘An idea or a fact is not worth more merely because it is easily
available to you.’” (Charles T. Munger)

Whenever someone struggles with finding a good topic to write about,someone else will recommend brainstorming. It still has a modern sound to it,even though it was described in 1919 by Alex Osborn and introduced to abroader audience in 1958 in the book “Brainstorming: The Dynamic New Way to Create Successful Ideas” from Charles Hutchison Clark. For manypeople, it is still the best method to generate new ideas. I suggest to see itrather as an expression of an outdated fixation on the brain, which is mirroredin the fixation of our educational system to learn things by heart – whichmeans to think without external tools. Testing students for memorisedknowledge does not give much indication about their understanding, and thefact that someone came up with a lot of ideas during a brainstorming sessiondoes not give much indication about their quality.

While we want to find topics that are important, interesting and can bedealt with using the material we have available, the brain prioritises ideas thatare easily available in the moment. This, obviously, does not equal relevant.The brain more easily remembers information that it encountered recently,which has emotions attached to it and is lively, concrete or specific. Ideally, itrhymes as well (cf. Schacter, 2001; Schacter, Chiao and Mitchell, 2003).Everything that is rather abstract, vague, emotionally neutral or does not evensound good is far down on its list of priorities – not exactly the best criteriafor an intellectual endeavour.

It makes things worse that we tend to like our first ideas the best and arevery reluctant to let go of them, irrespective of their actual relevance (Strackand Mussweiler 1997). And before you now wonder if it would be a goodidea to overcome the limitations of brainstorming by assembling a group offriends to brainstorm together, forget it: More people in a brainstorminggroup usually come up with less good ideas and restrict themselvesinadvertently to a narrower range of topics (Mullen, Johnson, and Salas 1991).38

But finding the right topic to write about is mostly a problem for those whotreated writing as a separate task from others, anyway – not for those of uswho work with the slip-box. Those who rely on their brains will first askthemselves, then their supervisor: I read so much, but what should I writeabout? On the other hand, we who have already accompanied our studies bywriting and collecting notes in a smart way simply don’t have the need forbrainstorming anymore. We can just look into our slip-box instead. If we hada good idea before (and it is certainly more likely that we will come up with agood idea over the course of several months rather than within a couple ofminutes), it will be in there. It might even already have proved itself worthy of following up on, in which case it is already connected to supportingmaterial. It is so much easier to see what worked than to predict what mightwork.

We don’t need to worry about the question of what to write about becausewe have answered the question already – many times on a daily basis. Everytime we read something, we make a decision on what is worth writing downand what is not. Every time we make a permanent note, we also made adecision about the aspects of a text we regarded as relevant for our longer-term thinking and relevant for the development of our ideas. We constantlymake explicit how ideas and information connect with each other and turnthem into literal connections between our notes. By doing this, we developvisible clusters of ideas that are now ready to be turned into manuscripts.The process is self-reinforcing. A visibly developed cluster attracts moreideas and provides more possible connections, which in return influence ourchoices on what to read and think further. They become signposts for ourdaily work and orient us to what is worth thinking about. Topics grow bottomup and gain traction along the way. As soon as the slip-box has grown a bit,we can replace our thoughts on what is interesting and what we think isrelevant with a pragmatic look into the slip-box, where we can plainly seewhat truly proved to be interesting and where we found material to workwith.

It is the one decision in the beginning, to make writing the mean and theend of the whole intellectual endeavour, that changed the role of topic-findingcompletely. It is now less about finding a topic to write about and more aboutworking on the questions we generated by writing.

By generating questions in the course of our everyday work, we bring thelaw of large numbers on our side. The truth is that few questions are suitableto be answered within an article, a thesis or a book. Some are too broad, someare too narrow, some are impossible to answer with knowledge we canreasonably acquire, but for most, we just don’t have the material to workwith. Those who start with a plan and an idea about what to write willprobably encounter that truth somewhere along the way. They then might beable to correct an unfortunate choice once or twice, but will have to stick withwhat they have chosen at one point, otherwise they will never finish theirproject.

If we, on the other hand, let questions arise from the slip-box, we know that they are tried and tested among dozens or even hundreds of otherpossible questions. The vast majority of questions might have been answeredquickly or disappeared as no notes were drawn to them, either because of alack of interest or a lack of material. This is how evolution works: by trialand error, not planning.

Good questions are in the sweet spot of being relevant and interesting, nottoo easy to answer but possible to tackle with material that is available or atleast within our reach. When it comes to finding good questions, it istherefore not enough to think about it. We have to do something with an ideabefore we know enough about it to make a good judgement. We have towork, write, connect, differentiate, complement and elaborate on questions –but this is what we do when we take smart notes.

#### _13.2 From Top Down to Bottom Up_

Developing topics and questions from what we have has a huge advantage.The ideas we decide on are not taken out of thin air, but are alreadyembedded in a content-rich context and come with material that we can use.Starting with what we have also comes with another, unexpected advantage:We become more open to new ideas.

It seems counterintuitive that we become more open to new ideas the morefamiliar we are with ideas we have already encountered, but historians ofscience will happily confirm this (Rheinberger 1997). It makes sense whenyou think about it: without intense elaboration on what we already know, wewould have trouble seeing its limitations, what is missing or possibly wrong.Being intimately familiar with something enables us to be playful with it, tomodify it, to spot new and different ideas without running the risk of merelyrepeating old ideas believing they are new. This is why it feels in thebeginning that familiarity makes it harder to come up with new ideas. We justdidn’t know that most of the ideas we had are actually not that innovative.But while the belief in our own ingenuity decreases with expertise, webecome more able to actually make a genuine new contribution.

Jacob Warren Getzels and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi showed that this isalso true in art: New, groundbreaking work is rarely created on a whim bysome accidental artist who believes himself to be amazingly innovative. Onthe contrary: The more time an artist devotes to learning about an aesthetic“problem,” the more unexpected and creative his solution will be regarded later by art experts (Getzels and Csikszentmihalyi 1976).

If open-mindedness is all that is needed, the best artists and scientists werehobbyists. Jeremy Dean, who has written extensively on routines and ritualsand suggests seeing old ways of thinking as thinking routines, puts it wellwhen he writes that we cannot break with a certain way of thinking if we arenot even aware that it is a certain way of thinking (Dean, 2013).

#### _13.3 Getting Things Done by Following Your Interests_

It is not surprising that motivation is shown to be one of the most importantindicators for successful students – next to the feeling of being in control ofone’s own learning course. When even highly intelligent students fail in theirstudies, it’s most often because they cease to see the meaning in what theywere supposed to learn (cf. Balduf 2009), are unable to make a connection totheir personal goals (Glynn et al. 2009) or lack the ability to control their ownstudies autonomously and on their own terms (Reeve and Jan, 2006; Reeve,2009).

These findings are an important argument for academic freedom. Nothingmotivates us more than seeing a project we can identify with movingforward, and nothing is more demotivating than being stuck with a projectthat doesn’t seem to be worth doing.

The risk of losing interest in what we do is high when we decide upfront ona long-term project without much clue about what to expect. We can mitigatethis risk considerably by applying a flexible organisation scheme that allowsus to change course whenever necessary.

If we accompany every step of our work with the question, “What isinteresting about this?” and everything we read with the question, “What is sorelevant about this that it is worth noting down?” we do not just chooseinformation according to our interest. By elaborating on what we encounter,we also discover aspects we didn’t know anything about before and thereforedevelop our interests along the way. It would be quite sad if we did notchange our interests during research.

The ability to change the direction of our work opportunistically is a formof control that is completely different from the attempt to control thecircumstances by clinging to a plan. The beginning of the research projectthat led to the discovery of DNA’s structure was the application for a grant.The grant was not to discover DNA’s structure, but find a treatment for cancer. If the scientists had stuck to their promises, not only would theyprobably not have found a cure for cancer, but they definitely would not havediscovered the structure of DNA. Most likely, they would have lost interest intheir work. Luckily, they did not stick to their plan, but followed theirintuition and interest and took the most promising path to insight wheneverone opened up. The actual research program developed along the way(Rheinberger 1997). One could say they finished the plan on what to do thevery moment they finished the whole project.

The ability to keep control over our work and change course if necessary ismade possible by the fact that the big task of “writing a text” is broken downinto small, concrete tasks, which allows us practically to do exactly what isneeded at a certain time and take the next step from there. It is not just aboutfeeling in control, it is about setting up the work in a way that we really are incontrol. And the more control we have to steer our work towards what weconsider interesting and relevant, the less willpower we have to put intogetting things done. Only then can work itself become the source ofmotivation, which is crucial to make it sustainable.

“When people experienced a sense of autonomy with regard to the choice, their energy for
subsequent tasks was not diminished. An important question that deserved empirical attention
concerns the potential for autonomous choice to vitalise or enhance self-regulatory strength
for subsequent tasks. What, for example, are the conditions that will lead autonomous choice
to enhance people’s motivation for new tasks? We suggest that among the factors that are
likely to affect whether choice will be vitalizing is the nature of the options being provided to
the person. If a person is offered choice among options that he or she does not value, that are
trivial or irrelevant, the choice is unlikely to be vitalizing and may be depleting, even if there
is no subtle pressure toward a particular option. On the other hand, having autonomous choice
among options that do have personal value may indeed be quite energizing.” (Moller, 2006, 1034)

Organizing the work so we can steer our projects in the most promisingdirection not only allows us to stay focused for longer, but also to have more fun – and that is a fact (Gilbert 2006).39

#### _13.4 Finishing and Review_

There is not much left to say about the last two steps because the main workis already done.

A key point: Structure the text and keep it flexible. While the slip-box wasvery much about experimenting with and generating new ideas, we now need to bring our thoughts into a linear order. The key is to structure the draftvisibly. It is not so much about deciding once and for all what to write inwhich chapter or paragraph, but what does not need to be written in aparticular part of the manuscript. By looking at the (always preliminary)structure, you can see if information will be mentioned in another part.The problem in this stage is almost exactly the opposite of the “blankscreen.” Instead of not knowing how to fill the pages, we have so much athand that we have to curb our impulse to mention everything at the sametime.

The desktop function of the Zettelkasten is the place to sort your notes fora particular project. It helps with developing a rough structure, but it alsoallows you to keep it flexible. The structure of an argument is part of it andtherefore will change during the process of developing it – it is not a vessel tobe filled with content. As soon as the structure not longer changes much, wecan happily call it a “table of contents.” But even then, it helps to see it as astructural guideline and not a prescription. It is not unusual to change theorder of chapters at the very end.

Another key point: Try working on different manuscripts at the same time.While the slip-box is already helpful to get one project done, its real strengthcomes into play when we start working on multiple projects at the same time.The slip-box is in some way what the chemical industry calls “verbund.” Thisis a setup in which the inevitable by-product of one production line becomesthe resource for another, which again produces by-products that can be usedin other processes and so on, until a network of production lines becomes soefficiently intertwined that there is no chance of an isolated factory competing with it anymore.40 ^ch13sec4par4

The process of reading and writing inevitably produces a lot of unintendedby-products. Not all ideas can fit into the same article, and only a fraction ofthe information we encounter is useful for one particular project.If we read something that is interesting, but not directly relevant to ourcurrent project, we can still use it for another project we are working on ormight work on. Everything that enriches our slip-box has the potential to endup in a text we might write. By taking smart notes, we collect en passant thematerial for our future writings in one place. The projects we work on can bein completely different stages of completion. Some of them might not even have come to our attention. This is advantageous not only because we makeprogress on the next papers or books while we are still working on the currentone, but also because it allows us to switch to other projects whenever we getstuck or bored.

Remember: Luhmann’s answer to the question of how one person could beso productive was that he never forced himself to do anything and only didwhat came easily to him. “When I am stuck for one moment, I leave it and dosomething else.” When he was asked what else he did when he was stuck, hisanswer was: “Well, writing other books. I always work on differentmanuscripts at the same time. With this method, to work on different thingssimultaneously, I never encounter any mental blockages.” (Luhmann, Baecker, and Stanitzek 1987, 125–55) It is like martial arts: If you encounterresistance or an opposing force, you should not push against it, but redirect ittowards another productive goal. The slip-box will always provide you withmultiple possibilities.

#### _13.5 Becoming an Expert by Giving up Planning_

One inconvenient truth in the end: The planning skills of students arepathetic.The psychologists Roger Buehler, Dale Griffin and Michael Ross asked agroup of students to:

1. \*Estimate realistically the time they would need to finish a paper.
2. Estimate additionally how long they think they would need

a. if everything goes as smoothly as possible or
b. if everything that could go wrong would go wrong.

Interestingly, the majority of the student’s “realistic” estimates were not sodifferent from their estimates for writing under perfect conditions. This aloneshould have given them pause for thought. But when the researchers checkedhow much time the students really needed, it was much, much longer thanthey estimated. Not even half of the students managed to finish their papersin the time they thought they would need under the worst possible conditions(Buehler, Griffin and Ross 1994). The researchers did not assume that half ofthe students suddenly faced calamities beyond their imagination.

In another study a year later, the psychologists looked more closely at this phenomenon, which still puzzled them because the students could haveanswered any way they liked – there was no benefit in giving overlyoptimistic answers. They asked the students to give them time ranges inwhich they were either 50%, 70% or 99% sure to finish their paper.Again: They were free to give any answer. But, sure enough, only 45%managed to get their papers done within the time they were sure they had a99% likelihood to finish it under any condition they regarded as possible(Buehler, Griffin, and Ross 1995). Now, you might think it would make adifference to remind them about their not-so-perfect guesses last time. Theresearchers thought so, but the students proved them wrong: Experiencedoesn’t seem to teach students anything.

But there is one consolation: It has nothing to do with being a student. Ithas something to do with being human. Even the people who study thisphenomenon, which is called the overconfidence bias, admit that they too fallfor it (Kahneman 2013, 245ff).

The lesson to draw is to be generally sceptical about planning, especially ifit is merely focused on the outcome, not on the actual work and the stepsrequired to achieve a goal. While it doesn’t help to imagine oneself the greatauthor of a successful and timely finished paper, it does make a difference ifwe have a realistic idea about what needs to be done to get there in ourminds. We know from sports that it doesn’t help when athletes imaginethemselves as winners of a race, but it makes a big difference if they imagineall the training that is necessary to be able to win. Having a more realisticidea in mind not only helps them to perform better, it also boosts theirmotivation (Singer et al. 2001). We know today that this is not only true forathletes, but for any work that needs effort and endurance (Pham and Taylor1999). Writing definitely belongs in this category.

The other lesson is not that we can’t learn from our experiences, but thatwe can only learn from our experiences if feedback follows shortlyafterwards – and maybe more than once in a while. Disassembling the bigchallenge of “writing a paper” into small, manageable tasks helps to setrealistic goals that can be checked on a regular basis. If someone starts fromthe unrealistic assumption that a paper can be written by following a linearplan of finding a topic first, doing literature research second, followed byseparable stages of reading, thinking, writing and proof-reading, then it is nosurprise that any time planning that is based on this assumption will be unrealistic as well. Once we do some research, we may discover that ourinitial idea was not as good as we thought; once we read something, it islikely that we will discover something else to read, because that is how wediscover literature; once we start writing down our arguments, it is likely thatwe will realise that we need to take something else into account, change ourinitial ideas or go back to an article we might not have understood wellenough. None of this is unusual, but all of this will mess up any grand plans.

If we instead set out to write, say, three notes on a specific day, review one paragraph we wrote the day before or check all the literature we discovered in an article, we know exactly at the end of the day what we were able to accomplish and can adjust our expectations for the next day. Getting hundreds of these cases of feedback over the course of a year will make us much more likely to learn from them and to become more realistic about our productivity than if we just miss a deadline once in a while, which, of course, will not happen again – until next time. ^ch13sec5par9

The problem with the linear model is not just that one phase might needlonger than planned, but that it is highly unlikely that we will finish a phasesooner than planned. If the whole problem was just an error in judgement, wewould on average overestimate the time we need as often as weunderestimate it, but unfortunately, that is not how it works. According to thefamous law of Parkinson, every kind of work tends to fill the time we setaside for it, like air fills every corner of a room (Parkinson 1957).While this is almost a universal law for longer time frames, the opposite istrue for tasks that can be completed in one go. This is partly due to theaforementioned Zeigarnik effect (Zeigarnik 1927), in which our brains tendto stay occupied with a task until it is accomplished (or written down). If wehave the finish line in sight, we tend to speed up, as everyone knows who hasever run a marathon. That means that the most important step is to get started.Rituals help, too (Currey 2013).

But the biggest difference lies in the task you are facing to start with. It ismuch easier to get started if the next step is as feasible as “writing a note,”“collect what is interesting in this paper” or “turning this series of notes into aparagraph” than if we decide to spend the next days with a vague and ill-defined task like “keep working on that overdue paper.”

#### 13.6 The Actual Writing

Ernest Hemingway was once asked how often he rewrote his first draft.His answer: “It depends. I rewrote the ending of ‘A Farewell to Arms,’ thelast page of it, thirty-nine times before I was satisfied.”

“Was there some technical problem there? What was it that had stumpedyou?” the interviewer asked.

“Getting the words right,” Hemingway replied (Paris Review, 1956).If there is one piece of advice that is worth giving, it is to keep in mind that the first draft is only the first draft. Slavoj Žižek said in an interview41 thathe wouldn’t be able to write a single sentence if he didn’t start by convincinghimself he was only writing down some ideas for himself, and that maybe hecould turn it into something publishable later. By the time he stopped writing,he was always surprised to find that the only thing left to do was revise thedraft he already had.

One of the most difficult tasks is to rigorously delete what has no function within an argument – “kill your darlings.”42 This becomes much easier when you move the questionable passages into another document and tell yourself you might use them later. For every document I write, I have another called “xy-rest.doc,” and every single time I cut something, I copy it into the other document, convincing myself that I will later look through it and add it back where it might fit. Of course, it never happens – but it still works. Others who know a thing or two about psychology do the same (cf. Thaler, 2015, 81f). ^ch13sec6par4

### 14 Make It a Habit

“It is a profoundly erroneous truism, repeated by all copybooks and by eminent people when
they are making speeches, that we should cultivate the habit of thinking of what we are doing.
The precise opposite is the case. Civilization advances by extending the number of important
operations which we can perform without thinking about them.” (Whitehead)[43]

The most reliable predictor of our behaviour in the immediate future is –surprise, surprise – the intention to do it. If we decide to go to the gym now,the chance is that we really do go to the gym now. But this is, unfortunately,only true for the very immediate future. When it comes to the long run,researchers struggle to find any measurable connection between ourintentions and our actual behaviour (Ji and Wood 2007; Neal et al. 2012).There is one exception, though: we most certainly act according to ourintention if we happen to intend to do exactly what we used to do before.It is really easy to predict the behaviour of people in the long run. In alllikelihood, we will do in a month, a year or two years from now exactly whatwe have done before: eat as many chocolates as before, go to the gym asoften as before, and get ourselves into the same kinds of arguments with ourpartners as before. To put it differently, good intentions don’t last very long,usually.

We have the best chance to change our behaviour over the long term if westart with a realistic idea about the difficulties of behavioural change (Dean2013). And that is not so easy, because the more we are used to doingsomething in a particular way, the more in control we feel about it, eventhough we are less in control of it. (This is in part also due to theaforementioned mere-exposure error.)

“Those with the strongest habits who were the least successful in predicting their behaviour
over the coming week were the most confident in their predictions. The finding is striking
because it hints at one of the dark sides of habits. When we perform an action repeatedly, its
familiarity seems to bleed back into our judgments about that behavior. We end up feeling we
have more control over precisely the behaviours that, in reality, we have the least control over.
It’s another example of our thought processes working in the opposite way to our intuitive
expectations.” (Dean 2013, 22)

The trick is not to try to break with old habits and also not to use willpower toforce oneself to do something else, but to strategically build up new habits that have a chance to replace the old ones. The goal here is to get into thehabit of fetching pen and paper whenever we read something, to write downthe most important and interesting aspects. If we manage to establish aroutine in this first step, it becomes much easier to develop the urge to turnthese findings into permanent notes and connect them with other notes in theslip-box. It is not so difficult to get used to thinking within an externalmemory of notes, as the advantages become obvious quite quickly. As soonas we have developed a new routine, we can do what intuitively feels right,which requires no effort. Watching others reading books and doing nothingother than underlining some sentences or making unsystematic notes that willend up nowhere will soon be a painful sight.

## AFTERWORD

The Take Smart Notes principle works. Many successful writers, artists andacademics use some form of a slip-box. This book is also written with thehelp of the slip-box. It was, for example, a note on “technology, acceptanceproblems” that pointed out to me that an answer to the question why somepeople struggle to implement the slip-box could be found in a book on thehistory of the shipping container. I certainly would not have looked for thatintentionally – doing research for a book on effective writing! This is just oneof many ideas and connections the slip-box pointed out to me. That it is notjust a tool to write more efficiently, but also a training device for seriouslong-term learning, should have been obvious to me, but wasn’t. Only when Iwas taking smart notes on more recent learning experiments did it dawn onme that I am in the middle of putting exactly into practice what is proven towork best. I want to point out, though, that I sometimes have ideas all bymyself.

The particular technique presented in this book enabled Niklas Luhmann tobecome one of the most productive and innovative social theorists of the lastcentury. There are increasing numbers of academics and nonfiction writers taking notice.44 But it is still not an easy sell for the majority of studentsand writers. There are different reasons for this. First of all, the long-term,*cross-topic organization of notes, which is guided only by one’s own*understanding and interest, is very much at odds with the modular,compartmentalised and top-down approach in which the curricula ofuniversities and colleges are organised. Teaching is still set up for review,and students are not really encouraged to independently build a network ofconnections between heterogeneous information – despite the radical changein our understanding on how our memory and learning works. There is a lotof talk about innovative approaches. But without changing the actualworkflow, this talk is idle. Some seemingly innovative ideas, like the“learner-centred” approach, often do more harm than good, as they still\*neglect the need for an external scaffolding to think in. It is not the learnerwho should be the focus of attention.

The slip-box does not put the learner in the centre. Quite the contrary: Itallows the learner to let his or her own thinking become decentralised withina network of other ideas. Learning, thinking and writing should not be aboutaccumulating knowledge, but about becoming a different person with adifferent way of thinking. This is done by questioning one’s own thinkingroutines in the light of new experiences and facts.

The prevalence of linear and learner-centred approaches also lead to thecommon misunderstanding about the use of the slip-box as a tool that can beused without changing the work routines around it. It is then often usedsimply as an archive where you just take out what you put in earlier. This, ofcourse, will lead to disappointment. If we are just storing information, therewould be no need to use a slip-box. To reap its benefits, we need to changeour working routines. And the basis for that is a deep understanding on howand why it works and how the different steps and tasks of writing fit together.This is why a book, not just a manual, is needed to explain the principle andideas behind it.

Another reason why this technique is still a hard sell is that most studentsonly realise the need for a good system when they already struggling withtheir writing, typically towards the end of the university program, when abachelor’s, master’s or doctoral thesis needs to be written. It certainly stillhelps, but it would have helped much more if one started earlier – very muchlike saving for retirement. It is also difficult to change behaviour in times ofstress. The more pressure we feel, the more we tend to stick to our oldroutines – even when these routines caused the problems and the stress in thefirst place. This is known as the tunnel effect (Mullainathan and Shafir 2013).But Mullainathan and Shafir, who examined this phenomenon thoroughly,also found a way out of it: Change is possible when the solution appears to besimple.

And that is the very good news at the end. The slip-box is as simple as itgets. Read with a pen in your hand, take smart notes and make connectionsbetween them. Ideas will come by themselves and your writing will developfrom there. There is no need to start from scratch. Keep doing what youwould do anyway: Read, think, write. Just take smart notes along the way.

[1] Cf. for example the writing guide of the University of Toronto:[http://www.writing.utoronto.ca/advice](http://www.writing.utoronto.ca/advice)[2] The research on willpower or “ego depletion” is in a bit of turmoil at the moment. But it is safe tosay that using willpower is a terrible strategy to get things done in the long run. For an overview:https://replicationindex.wordpress.com/2016/04/18/is-replicability-report-ego-depletionreplicability-report-of-165-ego-depletion-articles/[3] The introduction to his theory was published in 1987 in the form of a book with the title “SocialSystems” and the book series number “666.” Those who were not aware of his note-taking systemmight have been tempted to think that this was not by chance, as his productivity could only havebeen explained by a deal with the devil.[4] https://youtu.be/qRSCKSPMuDc?t=37m30s (all links are on takesmartnotes.com)[5] On the back of his notes, you will find not only manuscript drafts, but also old bills or drawingsby his children.[6] In the program Zettelkasten, the desktop is where you can bring notes into project-specific order.Each project should have its own desktop. If you use pen and paper, use your actual desktop.[7] This problem is known as Meno’s paradox (Plato, Meno 80e, Grube translation).[8] SQ3R is the acronym for “Survey, Question, Read, Recite, Review,” developed by psychologyprofessor Francis Pleasant Robinson for the U.S. Army during World War II (Robinson, 1978).[9] SQ4R, “Survey, Question, Read, Reflect, Recite, Review” will most certainly be replaced soonby SQ5R – whatever that will stand for.[10] While there are no official apps for smartphones available at the moment, there are multiple third-party solutions for both Android and iOS.[11] Google Monty Python “How to Play the Flute”.[12] Unfortunately most of it is in German: [http://www.uni-bielefeld.de/soz/luhmann-archiv/](http://www.uni-bielefeld.de/soz/luhmann-archiv/)[13] Whenever no published English version of a German text is available, the translation is by myself.[14] Guide to Academic Writing, English and American Studies, University of Bayreuth.[15] Writing and Style Guide for University Papers and Assignments, First version prepared byFrançois-Pierre Gingras (1998), School of Political Studies, Faculty of Social Sciences, Universityof Ottawa.[16] And, of course, it is addressing the “fear of the blank page” (Kruse 2005).[17] Ryfe and Kemmelmeier not only show that this development goes much further back into thepast and first appeared in newspapers (the quotes of politicians got almost halved between 1892 and1968), but also posed the question if this can maybe also be seen as a form of increasedprofessionalism of the media as they do not just let politicians talk as they wish (Ryfe and

Kemmelmeier 2011). Craig Fehrman also pointed out the irony in the reception of this rathernuanced study – it was itself reduced to a soundbite in the media (Fehrman 2011).[18] As much as Csikszentmihalyi’s concept of flow became part of everyday language, it was neverthoroughly examined. In the 1960’s, some studies in the Soviet Union focused on “postvoluntaryattention,” which basically means the same thing – an attention without effort that is neitherinvoluntary nor voluntary. But almost all of the study results are only available in Russian andnever found their way into the international psychological discourse. (Cf. Bruya 2010, 4 withreference to Dobrynin 1966).[19] Flyvbjerg describes this experiment and example not only with reference to the book of Dreyfusand Dreyfus, but also with reference to extensive talks with them. I therefore stick with thedescription in Flyvbjerg 2001.[20] This is even true for highly specialised surgeons (Gawande 2002).[21] Here 11 95 82 19 62 31 96 64 19 70 51 97 4 becomes 1. 1958 2. 1962 3. 1966 4. 1970 5. 1974[22] It is almost impossible to overstate the importance of taking care of the little things. Not only arewe easily distracted by mundane thoughts, we also routinely forget small but important things whenwe don’t externalise them. This is why checklists are so important wherever something serious is atstake (cf. Gawande 2010).[23] Even though this is not a new discovery, it is now confirmed by neuroscientists and experimentalpsychologists alike (Doyle and Zakrajsek 2013 ref. Tambini, A., Ketz, N., and Davachi, L. 2010).[24] Neuroscientists would call it long-term potentiation (Bliss, Collingridge, and Morris 2004).[25] There is plenty of proof that sleeping aids in memorization (cf. for example Wagner et al. 2004)and can help to find solutions to problems (Wamsley et al. 2010).[26] Franklin 1840, 250.[27] Here is an example: [http://ds.ub.uni-bielefeld.de/viewer/](http://ds.ub.uni-bielefeld.de/viewer/)toc/ZK_digital/1/#LOG_0000[28] Cf. Wolfe and Britt, 2008.[29] They claim this quote is from (Jang et al. 2012), but I couldn’t find it there. Anyway: It is a goodway to put it.[30] According to different personal encounters.[31] About $30,000 adjusted for inflation.[32] About $200,000 if you take the 7% the S&P500 achieved historically adjusted for inflation.[33] “Genius: The Life And Science of Richard Feynman,” James Gleick, Pantheon Books, 1992 (seepg. 409).[34] Just for fun, check a few references in the aforementioned book from Doyle and Zakrajsek. I betyou won’t have to search long to find surprising results (Doyle and Zakrajsek 2013).[35] You are less prone to make this error in judgement if you know about it (Rassin 2014). You arewelcome.[36] An exception might be the author of my favourite TripAdvisor review. He wrote of a museum Ivisited (and enjoyed): “There’s really not much to see in this museum. Just several buildings withpaintings hanging on the walls.” (Google: User Ondska Museum Puri Lukisan)[37] [http://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-152-carol-loomis](http://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-152-carol-loomis)[38] You can avoid that, though, by letting all members brainstorm for themselves and compiling theresults afterwards.[39] If that doesn’t convince you, then maybe the fact that the feeling of being in control lengthensyour life (Langer and Rodin 1976; Rodin and Langer 1977). That is equally as well understood asthe opposite: The loss of control has a negative effect on your health (M. G. Marmot et al. 1997).As a short overview, cf. Michael G. Marmot 2006.

[40] The first and most developed “verbund” is located in Ludwigshafen, Germany. It belongs toBASF, the world’s biggest chemical company and one of the most consistently profitable, despitebeing located in a highly developed country with high wages and social security costs.[41] In the movie Žižek! (USA 2005; Astra Taylor).[42] The quote is variably attributed to William Faulkner, Allen Ginsberg, Oscar Wilde, StephenKing and others. It seems that the critic Arthur Quiller-Couch mentioned it first when he told hisstudents at Cambridge in 1914: “If you here require a practical rule of me, I will present you withthis: Whenever you feel an impulse to perpetrate a piece of exceptionally fine writing, obey it—wholeheartedly—and delete it before sending your manuscript to press. Murder your darlings.”(Quiller-Couch 2006, 203)[43] Alfred North Whitehead, 1911, 61.[44] Cf. the discussions in the forum for the program zettelkasten.de
