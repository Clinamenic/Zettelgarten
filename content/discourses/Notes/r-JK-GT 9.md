[[Keynes_GeneralTheory#Chapter 2, Section IV]]

In this section, Keynes defines involuntary unemployment as a phenomenon resulting from circumstances wherein the real wages decrease and both the aggregate supply and aggregate demand for labor at the give money wage exceeds the given capacity for employment.
