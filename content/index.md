Welcome to the zettelgarten of Spencer Saar Cavanaugh, a curated externalization of an internal knowledge management system.

Inspired by Luhmann's [zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) ("note box") methodology and by the concept of a digital garden, this zettelgarten is an experiment in self-publishing, independent research, and knowledge architecture.
