## OODA Loop

From Wikipedia:

The **OODA loop** (observe, orient, decide, act) is a decision-making model developed by [military strategist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_strategy "Military strategy") and [United States Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force "United States Air Force") Colonel [John Boyd](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Boyd_(military_strategist)> "John Boyd (military strategist)"). He applied the concept to the [combat operations process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_operations_process "Combat operations process"), often at the operational level during military campaigns. It is often applied to understand commercial operations and learning processes. The approach explains how agility can overcome raw power in dealing with human opponents.
