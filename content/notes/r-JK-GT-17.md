Is it accurate to say that, in the course of negotiating money wages as an imperfect representation of real wages, entrepreneurs don't want real wages to exceed the marginal utility of utility of labor, and workers don't want real wages to fall below the marginal disutility of labor? And that employment can increase so long as 1) real wages fall between marginal utility of labor and marginal disutility of labor, and 2) that aggregate demand price is equal to or greater that aggregate supply price?
