Here, Keynes suggests that laborers may not actively to a decrease in real wages, as they would to a decrease in money wages, largely because they do not exercise as much control over the determination of their real wages as they over the determination of their money wages. Keynes here seems to imply that the classical theory tends to erroneously conflate the roles played by real wages and money wages in the dynamics of wage bargaining.
