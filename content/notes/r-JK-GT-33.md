Re: [[Keynes_GeneralTheory#Chapter 8, Section IV]]

In section 8.4, Keynes argues that the existing national macroeconomic accounting practices are inadequate in terms of informing employment strategies, because of the reliance on the classical theory which does not dynamically evaluate relationships between aggregate supply and demand functions. He gives several examples of figures obtained around macroeconomics, but its not quite clear to me what this section ultimately amounts to. I know it generally has to do with the sustainability of employment-maximizing strategies.
